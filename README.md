# **_ Hi, you have reached at Mahesh's GitHub profile _**
### 🌸 About me ?
I am INFJ-A, most of the time. Having a discussion about human psychology, count me in, apart from that I am interested in Science, The Universe, and all other super cool stuff including Aliens 🤫. Just like the rest I am also a CS engineer, I try to learn new stuff and on it's way I implement it in my own style. 
- ☮ My side activities: 🎨♟🎧🌐
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the things that I don't know.
- 😄 Pronouns: He would be fine.
- ⚡ Fun fact: The QWERTY keyboard layout was designed to slow you down.

### 🔰 While you are still here have a look at some random quotes
*It changes every day*

<!-- BLOG-POST-LIST:START -->
 1.  "This is something that I do consider to be good advice: I took my first paycheck and I put it in the goddamn bank. Then I took my second paycheck and put it in the goddamn bank. I had seen the roller coaster of my father's career - top of the world, then unemployed - and I never wanted to take a job because I needed money." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Joss Whedon</i> 

 2.  "By desiring little, a poor man makes himself rich." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Democritus</i> 

 3.  "What makes something special is not just what you have to gain, but what you feel there is to lose." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Andre Agassi</i> 

 4.  "The reason most people never reach their goals is that they don't define them, or ever seriously consider them as believable or achievable. Winners can tell you where they are going, what they plan to do along the way, and who will be sharing the adventure with them." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Denis Watley</i>
