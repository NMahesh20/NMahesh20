# **_ Hi, you have reached at Mahesh's GitHub profile _**
### 🌸 About me ?
I am INFJ-A, most of the time. Having a discussion about human psychology, count me in, apart from that I am interested in Science, The Universe, and all other super cool stuff including Aliens 🤫. Just like the rest I am also a CS engineer, I try to learn new stuff and on it's way I implement it in my own style. 
- ☮ My side activities: 🎨♟🎧🌐
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the things that I don't know.
- 😄 Pronouns: He would be fine.
- ⚡ Fun fact: The QWERTY keyboard layout was designed to slow you down.

### 🔰 While you are still here have a look at some random quotes
*It changes every day*

<!-- BLOG-POST-LIST:START -->
 1.  "I have no faith in human perfectability. I think that human exertion will have no appreciable effect upon humanity. Man is now only more active - not more happy - nor more wise, than he was 6000 years ago." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Edgar Allan Poe</i> 

 2.  "Do what you love, love what you do, leave the world a better place and don't pick your nose." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Jeff Mallett</i> 

 3.  "In Kyudo philosophy, you don't aim--you become one with the target. Then, in fact, there's nothing to aim at. I find it works well with women, too. Give it a try." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Martin Sage and Sybil Adelman</i> 

 4.  "Force is all-conquering, but its victories are short-lived." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Abraham Lincoln</i>
