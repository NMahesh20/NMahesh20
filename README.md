### 🔰 While you are still here have a look at some random quotes
*It changes every day*

<!-- BLOG-POST-LIST:START -->
 1.  "A person can learn a lot from a dog, even a loopy one like ours. Marley taught me about living each day with unbridled exuberance and joy, about seizing the moment and following your heart. He taught me to appreciate the simple things - a walk in the woods, a fresh snowfall, a nap in a shaft of winter sunlight. And as he grew old and achy, he taught me about optimism in the face of adversity. Mostly, he taught me about friendship and selflessness and, above all else, unwavering loyalty." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by John Grogan</i> 

 2.  "" <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Francis Ford Coppola</i> 

 3.  "Use what talents you possess: the woods would be very silent if no birds sang there except those that sang best." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Henry Van Dyke</i> 

 4.  "Self-esteem is the reputation we acquire with ourselves." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Nathaniel Branden</i>
