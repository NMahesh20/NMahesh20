# **_ Hi, you have reached at Mahesh's GitHub profile _**
### 🌸 About me ?
I am INFJ-A, most of the time. Having a discussion about human psychology, count me in, apart from that I am interested in Science, The Universe, and all other super cool stuff including Aliens 🤫. Just like the rest I am also a CS engineer, I try to learn new stuff and on it's way I implement it in my own style. 
- ☮ My side activities: 🎨♟🎧🌐
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the things that I don't know.
- 😄 Pronouns: He would be fine.
- ⚡ Fun fact: The QWERTY keyboard layout was designed to slow you down.

### 🔰 While you are still here have a look at some random quotes
*It changes every day*

<!-- BLOG-POST-LIST:START -->
 1.  "Moments of kindness and reconciliation are worth having, even if the parting has to come sooner or later." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Alice Munro</i> 

 2.  "If any one faculty of our nature may be called more wonderful than the rest, I do think it is memory. There seems something more speakingly incomprehensible in the powers, the failures, the inequalities of memory, than in any other of our intelligences. The memory is sometimes so retentive, so serviceable, so obedient; at others, so bewildered and so weak; and at others again, so tyrannic, so beyond control! We are, to be sure, a miracle every way; but our powers of recollecting and of forgetting do seem peculiarly past finding out." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Jane Austen</i> 

 3.  "A woman can forgive a man for the harm he does her...but she can never forgive him for the sacrifices he makes on her account." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by W. Somerset Maugham</i> 

 4.  "Because I have loved life, I shall have no sorrow to die." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Amelia Burr</i>
