# **_ Hi, you have reached at Mahesh's GitHub profile _**
### 🌸 About me ?
I am INFJ-A, most of the time. Having a discussion about human psychology, count me in, apart from that I am interested in Science, The Universe, and all other super cool stuff including Aliens 🤫. Just like the rest I am also a CS engineer, I try to learn new stuff and on it's way I implement it in my own style. 
- ☮ My side activities: 🎨♟🎧🌐
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the things that I don't know.
- 😄 Pronouns: He would be fine.
- ⚡ Fun fact: The QWERTY keyboard layout was designed to slow you down.

### 🔰 While you are still here have a look at some random quotes
*It changes every day*

<!-- BLOG-POST-LIST:START -->
 1.  "One of the joys we have in being human is in exercising our freedom to choose and to take each case as it comes to us. We are not robots who are forced into behaviors by their programming. We see things; we think about things; and we choose our course of action or beliefs appropriately. And as long as that remains true of us, we will live every day of our lives on one slippery slope or another. There is no reason to fear this." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Gordon Atkinson</i> 

 2.  "Is love supposed to last throughout all time, or is it like trains changing at random stops. If I loved her, how could I leave her? If I felt that way then, how come I don't feel anything now?" <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Jeff Melvoin</i> 

 3.  "The price of greatness is responsibility." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Sir Winston Churchill</i> 

 4.  "Opportunity is missed by most people because it is dressed in overalls and looks like work." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Thomas A. Edison</i>
