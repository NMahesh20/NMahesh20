# **_ Hi, you have reached at Mahesh's GitHub profile _**
### 🌸 About me ?
I am INFJ-A, most of the time. Having a discussion about human psychology, count me in, apart from that I am interested in Science, The Universe, and all other super cool stuff including Aliens 🤫. Just like the rest I am also a CS engineer, I try to learn new stuff and on it's way I implement it in my own style. 
- ☮ My side activities: 🎨♟🎧🌐
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the things that I don't know.
- 😄 Pronouns: He would be fine.
- ⚡ Fun fact: The QWERTY keyboard layout was designed to slow you down.

### 🔰 While you are still here have a look at some random quotes
*It changes every day*

<!-- BLOG-POST-LIST:START -->
 1.  "If we choose only to expose ourselves to opinions and viewpoints that are in line to our own, we become more polarized, more set in our own ways. It will only reinforce and deepen the political divides in our country. But if we choose to actively seek out information that challenges our assumptions and beliefs, perhaps we can begin to understand where the people who disagree with us are coming from." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Barack Obama</i> 

 2.  "What has a man's face to do with his character? Can a man of good character help having a disagreeable face?" <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Ann Radcliffe</i> 

 3.  "If you want peace, stop fighting. If you want peace of mind, stop fighting with your thoughts." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Peter McWilliams</i> 

 4.  "It is hard to fight an enemy who has outposts in your head." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Sally Kempton</i>
