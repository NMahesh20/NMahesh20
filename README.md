# **_ Hi, you have reached at Mahesh's GitHub profile _**
### 🌸 About me ?
I am INFJ-A, most of the time. Having a discussion about human psychology, count me in, apart from that I am interested in Science, The Universe, and all other super cool stuff including Aliens 🤫. Just like the rest I am also a CS engineer, I try to learn new stuff and on it's way I implement it in my own style. 
- ☮ My side activities: 🎨♟🎧🌐
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the things that I don't know.
- 😄 Pronouns: He would be fine.
- ⚡ Fun fact: The QWERTY keyboard layout was designed to slow you down.

### 🔰 While you are still here have a look at some random quotes
*It changes every day*

<!-- BLOG-POST-LIST:START -->
 1.  "Famous I don't know about. It's hard to be famous and alive. I just want to play music every day and hear someone say, 'Thanks, that was great, here's some money, same time tomorrow, okay?'" <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Terry Pratchett</i> 

 2.  "If you don't think your life is worth more than someone else's, sign your donor card and kill yourself now." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Matthew V. Lewis</i> 

 3.  "When you close your doors, and make darkness within, remember never to say that you are alone, for you are not alone; nay, God is within, and your genius is within. And what need have they of light to see what you are doing?" <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Epictetus</i> 

 4.  "In peace there's nothing so becomes a man/
As modest stillness and humility;/
But when the blast of war blows in our ears,/
Then imitate the action of the tiger:/
Stiffen the sinews, summon up the blood." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by William Shakespeare</i>
