### 🔰 While you are still here have a look at some random quotes
*It changes every day*

<!-- BLOG-POST-LIST:START -->
 1.  "Perfectionism is simply putting a limit on your future. When you have an idea of perfect in your mind, you open the door to constantly comparing what you have now with what you want. That type of self criticism is significantly deterring." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by John Eliot, Ph.D.</i> 

 2.  "I have witnessed the softening of the hardest of hearts by a simple smile." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Goldie Hawn</i> 

 3.  "Many people think that if they were only in some other place, or had some other job, they would be happy. Well, that is doubtful. So get as much happiness out of what you are doing as you can and don't put off being happy until some future date." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Dale Carnegie</i> 

 4.  "To see what is right, and not to do it, is want of courage or of principle." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Confucius</i>
