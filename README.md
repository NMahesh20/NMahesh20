# **_ Hi, you have reached at Mahesh's GitHub profile _**
### 🌸 About me ?
I am INFJ-A, most of the time. Having a discussion about human psychology, count me in, apart from that I am interested in Science, The Universe, and all other super cool stuff including Aliens 🤫. Just like the rest I am also a CS engineer, I try to learn new stuff and on it's way I implement it in my own style. 
- ☮ My side activities: 🎨♟🎧🌐
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the things that I don't know.
- 😄 Pronouns: He would be fine.
- ⚡ Fun fact: The QWERTY keyboard layout was designed to slow you down.

*It changes every day*

<!-- BLOG-POST-LIST:START -->
 1.  "Whenever you looked forward to anything pleasant you were sure to be more or less disappointed . . . perhaps that is true. But there is a good side to it too. The bad things don't always come up to your expectations either . . . they nearly always turn out ever so much better than you think." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by L. M. Montgomery</i> 

 2.  "The difference between a moral man and a man of honor is that the latter regrets a discreditable act, even when it has worked and he has not been caught." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by H. L. Mencken</i> 

 3.  "Do not hire a man who does your work for money, but him who does it for love of it." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Henry David Thoreau</i> 

 4.  "Don't let your sorrow come higher than your knees." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Swedish Proverb</i>
