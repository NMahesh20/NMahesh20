# **_ Hi, you have reached at Mahesh's GitHub profile _**
### 🌸 About me ?
I am INFJ-A, most of the time. Having a discussion about human psychology, count me in, apart from that I am interested in Science, The Universe, and all other super cool stuff including Aliens 🤫. Just like the rest I am also a CS engineer, I try to learn new stuff and on it's way I implement it in my own style. 
- ☮ My side activities: 🎨♟🎧🌐
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the things that I don't know.
- 😄 Pronouns: He would be fine.
- ⚡ Fun fact: The QWERTY keyboard layout was designed to slow you down.

### 🔰 While you are still here have a look at some random quotes
*It changes every day*

<!-- BLOG-POST-LIST:START -->
 1.  "You really haven't changed, you've just become more of yourself. That is really what were all trying to do: become more of ourselves." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Oprah Winfrey</i> 

 2.  "I think the promise of fame and what it holds to you as a child and dreaming of it is not what it is. What it is, I'm not complaining about, but it's just different than the reality you dreamed." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Rosie O'Donnell</i> 

 3.  "Success is meaningless if you can't sleep at night because of harsh things said, petty secrets sharpened against hard and stony regret, just waiting to be plunged into the soft underbelly of a 'friendship.'" <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Margaret Cho</i> 

 4.  "One must also accept that one has 'uncreative' moments. The more honestly one can accept that, the quicker these moments will pass." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Etty Hillesum</i>
