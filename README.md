### 🌸 About me ?
I am INFJ-A, most of the time. Having a discussion about human psychology, count me in, apart from that I am interested in Science, The Universe, and all other super cool stuff including Aliens 🤫. Just like the rest I am also a CS engineer, I try to learn new stuff and on it's way I implement it in my own style. 
- ☮ My side activities: 🎨♟🎧🌐
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the things that I don't know.
- 😄 Pronouns: He would be fine.
- ⚡ Fun fact: The QWERTY keyboard layout was designed to slow you down.

### 🔰 While you are still here have a look at some random quotes
*It changes every day*

<!-- BLOG-POST-LIST:START -->
 1.  "You learn more quickly under the guidance of experienced teachers. You waste a lot of time going down blind alleys if you have no one to lead you." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by W. Somerset Maugham</i> 

 2.  "I will never forget who this victory truly belongs to. It belongs to you. It belongs to you. I was never the likeliest candidate for this office. We didn't start with much money or many endorsements. Our campaign was not hatched in the halls of Washington. It began in the backyards of Des Moines and the living rooms of Concord and the front porches of Charleston. It was built by working men and women who dug into what little savings they had to give $5 and $10 and $20 to the cause." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Barack Obama</i> 

 3.  "I have very strong feelings about how you lead your life. You always look ahead, you never look back." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Ann Richards</i> 

 4.  "Despise not any man, and do not spurn anything; for there is no man who has not his hour, nor is there anything that has not its place." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Ben Azai</i>
