# **_ Hi, you have reached at Mahesh's GitHub profile _**
### 🌸 About me ?
I am INFJ-A, most of the time. Having a discussion about human psychology, count me in, apart from that I am interested in Science, The Universe, and all other super cool stuff including Aliens 🤫. Just like the rest I am also a CS engineer, I try to learn new stuff and on it's way I implement it in my own style. 
- ☮ My side activities: 🎨♟🎧🌐
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the things that I don't know.
- 😄 Pronouns: He would be fine.
- ⚡ Fun fact: The QWERTY keyboard layout was designed to slow you down.

### 🔰 While you are still here have a look at some random quotes
*It changes every day*

<!-- BLOG-POST-LIST:START -->
 1.  "I'd heard it all the time, 'Live in the moment.' But if I did that, I'd weigh more than a dump truck. Losing weight wasn't about the moment at all; it was about having faith in the future. It was about knowing there would be another meal in a few hours." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Stephanie Klein</i> 

 2.  "It is only necessary to make war with five things; with the maladies of the body, the ignorances of the mind, with the passions of the body, with the seditions of the city and the discords of families." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Pythagoras</i> 

 3.  "Politeness and consideration for others is like investing pennies and getting dollars back." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Thomas Sowell</i> 

 4.  "If we cannot live so as to be happy, let us least live so as to deserve it." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Immanuel Hermann Fichte</i>
