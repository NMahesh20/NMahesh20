# **_ Hi, you have reached at Mahesh's GitHub profile _**
### 🌸 About me ?
I am INFJ-A, most of the time. Having a discussion about human psychology, count me in, apart from that I am interested in Science, The Universe, and all other super cool stuff including Aliens 🤫. Just like the rest I am also a CS engineer, I try to learn new stuff and on it's way I implement it in my own style. 
- ☮ My side activities: 🎨♟🎧🌐
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the things that I don't know.
- 😄 Pronouns: He would be fine.
- ⚡ Fun fact: The QWERTY keyboard layout was designed to slow you down.

### 🔰 While you are still here have a look at some random quotes
*It changes every day*

<!-- BLOG-POST-LIST:START -->
 1.  "We all flow from one fountain Soul. All are expressions of one Love. God does not appear, and flow out, only from narrow chinks and round bored wells here and there in favored races and places, but He flows in grand undivided currents, shoreless and boundless over creeds and forms and all kinds of civilizations and peoples and beasts, saturating all and fountainizing all." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by John Muir</i> 

 2.  "What we truly and earnestly aspire to be, that in some sense, we are. The mere aspiration, by changing the frame of the mind, for the moment realizes itself." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Anna Jameson</i> 

 3.  "Fear is the tax that conscience pays to guilt." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by George Sewell</i> 

 4.  "I really do believe I can accomplish a great deal with a big grin, I know some people find that disconcerting, but that doesn't matter." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Beverly Sills</i>
