# **_ Hi, you have reached at Mahesh's GitHub profile _**
### 🌸 About me ?
I am INFJ-A, most of the time. Having a discussion about human psychology, count me in, apart from that I am interested in Science, The Universe, and all other super cool stuff including Aliens 🤫. Just like the rest I am also a CS engineer, I try to learn new stuff and on it's way I implement it in my own style. 
- ☮ My side activities: 🎨♟🎧🌐
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the things that I don't know.
- 😄 Pronouns: He would be fine.
- ⚡ Fun fact: The QWERTY keyboard layout was designed to slow you down.

### 🔰 While you are still here have a look at some random quotes
*It changes every day*

<!-- BLOG-POST-LIST:START -->
 1.  "Never underestimate the determination of a kid who is time rich and cash poor." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Cory Doctorow</i> 

 2.  "The shortest route to getting things done is just do it." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Takayuki Ikkaku, Arisa Hosaka and Toshihiro Kawabata</i> 

 3.  "The old ways are dead. And you need people around you who concur./ That means hanging out more with the creative people, the freaks, the real visionaries, than you're already doing. Thinking more about what their needs are, and responding accordingly. Avoid the dullards; avoid the folk who play it safe. They can't help you any more. Their stability model no longer offers that much stability. They are extinct, they are extinction." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Hugh Macleod</i> 

 4.  "One picture is worth a thousand words." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Fred R. Barnard</i>
