# **_ Hi, you have reached Mahesh's GitHub profile _**
### 🌸 About me ?
My persona falls under INFJ-A, or as per the <a href="https://bigfive-test.com/result/692c68083b5a3f3f12dd9937"> Big-5 metrics</a>. Having a discussion about human psychology, count me in. Apart from that, I am also interested in Science, the Universe, and all other super cool stuff, including Aliens 🤫. Just like the rest, I am also a CS engineer. I try to learn new stuff, and on the way, I implement it in my own style. 
- ☮ My side activities: 🎨♟🎧🌐
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the things that I don't know.
- 😄 Pronouns: He would be fine.
- ⚡ Fun fact: The QWERTY keyboard layout was designed to slow you down.

### 🔰 While you are still here, have a look at some random quotes
*It changes every day*

<!-- BLOG-POST-LIST:START -->
 1.  "That isn’t about money, fame, or power. It’s about will, dedication, commitment, and knowing your self-worth. You can be poor as dirt and have those traits. Money can’t buy you values. You just need to know what is important to you and then feel secure in your pursuit to achieve that." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Jennifer Hudson</i> 

 2.  "Retribution often means that we eventually do to ourselves what we have done unto others." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Eric Hoffer</i> 

 3.  "It is not giving children more that spoils them; it is giving them more to avoid confrontation." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by John Gray</i> 

 4.  "Resolve to be thyself: and know, that he who finds himself, loses his misery." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Matthew Arnold</i>
