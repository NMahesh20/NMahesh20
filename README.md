# **_ Hi, you have reached at Mahesh's GitHub profile _**
### 🌸 About me ?
I am INFJ-A, most of the time. Having a discussion about human psychology, count me in, apart from that I am interested in Science, The Universe, and all other super cool stuff including Aliens 🤫. Just like the rest I am also a CS engineer, I try to learn new stuff and on it's way I implement it in my own style. 
- ☮ My side activities: 🎨♟🎧🌐
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the things that I don't know.
- 😄 Pronouns: He would be fine.
- ⚡ Fun fact: The QWERTY keyboard layout was designed to slow you down.

<!-- BLOG-POST-LIST:START -->
 1.  "Part of being creative is learning how to protect your freedom. That includes freedom from avarice." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Hugh Macleod</i> 

 2.  "You don't pay back your parents. You can't. The debt you owe them gets collected by your children, who hand it down in turn. It's a sort of entailment. Or if you don't have children of the body, it's left as a debt to your common humanity. Or to your God, if you possess or are possessed by one." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Lois McMaster Bujold</i> 

 3.  "A good home must be made, not bought." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Joyce Maynard</i>
