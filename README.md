# **_ Hi, you have reached at Mahesh's GitHub profile _**
### 🌸 About me ?
I am INFJ-A, most of the time. Having a discussion about human psychology, count me in, apart from that I am interested in Science, The Universe, and all other super cool stuff including Aliens 🤫. Just like the rest I am also a CS engineer, I try to learn new stuff and on it's way I implement it in my own style. 
- ☮ My side activities: 🎨♟🎧🌐
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the things that I don't know.
- 😄 Pronouns: He would be fine.
- ⚡ Fun fact: The QWERTY keyboard layout was designed to slow you down.

*It changes every day*

<!-- BLOG-POST-LIST:START -->
 1.  "You know what it's like to wake up in the middle of the night with a vivid dream? And you know that if you don't have a pencil and pad by the bed, it will be completely gone by the next morning. Sometimes it's important to wake up and stop dreaming. When a really great dream shows up, grab it." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Larry Page</i> 

 2.  "To the soul, there is hardly anything more healing than friendship." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Thomas Moore</i> 

 3.  "A successful marriage is an edifice that must be rebuilt every day." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Andre Maurois</i> 

 4.  "War is not its own end, except in some catastrophic slide into absolute damnation. It's peace that's wanted. Some better peace than the one you started with." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Lois McMaster Bujold</i>
