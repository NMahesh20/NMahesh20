# **_ Hi, you have reached at Mahesh's GitHub profile _**
### 🌸 About me ?
I am INFJ-A, most of the time. Having a discussion about human psychology, count me in, apart from that I am interested in Science, The Universe, and all other super cool stuff including Aliens 🤫. Just like the rest I am also a CS engineer, I try to learn new stuff and on it's way I implement it in my own style. 
- ☮ My side activities: 🎨♟🎧🌐
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the things that I don't know.
- 😄 Pronouns: He would be fine.
- ⚡ Fun fact: The QWERTY keyboard layout was designed to slow you down.

 1.  "I'm moving, but don't worry! [Someone once] told me we're all on the same planet, so I'll be okay!" <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Takayuki Ikkaku, Arisa Hosaka and Toshihiro Kawabata</i> 

 2.  "I will not allow yesterday's success to lull me into today's complacency, for this is the great foundation of failure." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Og Mandino</i> 

 3.  "I do nothing but go about persuading you all, old and young alike, not to take thought for your persons or your properties, but and chiefly to care about the greatest improvement of the soul. I tell you that virtue is not given by money, but that from virtue comes money and every other good of man, public as well as private. This is my teaching, and if this is the doctrine which corrupts the youth, I am a mischievous person." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Socrates</i> 

 4.  "Success is counted sweetest by those who ne'er succeed." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Emily Dickinson</i>
