# **_ Hi, you have reached at Mahesh's GitHub profile _**
### 🌸 About me ?
I am INFJ-A, most of the time. Having a discussion about human psychology, count me in, apart from that I am interested in Science, The Universe, and all other super cool stuff including Aliens 🤫. Just like the rest I am also a CS engineer, I try to learn new stuff and on it's way I implement it in my own style. 
- ☮ My side activities: 🎨♟🎧🌐
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the things that I don't know.
- 😄 Pronouns: He would be fine.
- ⚡ Fun fact: The QWERTY keyboard layout was designed to slow you down.

### 🔰 While you are still here have a look at some random quotes
*It changes every day*

<!-- BLOG-POST-LIST:START -->
 1.  "It is very difficult to know people and I don't think one can ever really know any but one's own countrymen. For men and women are not only themselves; they are also the region in which they are born, the city apartment or the farm in which they learnt to walk, the games they played as children, the old wives' tales they overheard, the food they ate, the schools they attended, the sports they followed, the poets they read, and the God they believed in. It is all these things that have made them what they are, and these are the things that you can't come to know by hearsay, you can only know them if you have lived them." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by W. Somerset Maugham</i> 

 2.  "Never grow a wishbone, daughter, where your backbone ought to be." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Clementine Paddleford</i> 

 3.  "When you have got an elephant by the hind leg, and he is trying to run away, it's best to let him run." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Abraham Lincoln</i> 

 4.  "If you can give your son or daughter only one gift, let it be enthusiasm." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Bruce Barton</i>
