# **_ Hi, you have reached at Mahesh's GitHub profile _**
### 🌸 About me ?
I am INFJ-A, most of the time. Having a discussion about human psychology, count me in, apart from that I am interested in Science, The Universe, and all other super cool stuff including Aliens 🤫. Just like the rest I am also a CS engineer, I try to learn new stuff and on it's way I implement it in my own style. 
- ☮ My side activities: 🎨♟🎧🌐
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the things that I don't know.
- 😄 Pronouns: He would be fine.
- ⚡ Fun fact: The QWERTY keyboard layout was designed to slow you down.

<!-- BLOG-POST-LIST:START -->
 1.  "The thing that I'm always left with is this overwhelming desire for people to be rooted and the only way that they feel rooted is through another person." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by John Allen</i> 

 2.  "It's always been about the experience of life and of not being passive. If something so excites my curiosty, I want to go there, be a part of whatever it is that's either pushing me or pulling me toward it. That desire for experience has made me very rich in life experience." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Tish Grier</i> 

 3.  "The victory of success is half won when one gains the habit of setting goals and achieving them.

 4.  "Don't laugh at a youth for his affectations; he is only trying on one face after another to find his own." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Logan Pearsall Smith</i>
