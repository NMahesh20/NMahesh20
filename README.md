# **_ Hi, you have reached at Mahesh's GitHub profile _**
### 🌸 About me ?
I am INFJ-A, most of the time. Having a discussion about human psychology, count me in, apart from that I am interested in Science, The Universe, and all other super cool stuff including Aliens 🤫. Just like the rest I am also a CS engineer, I try to learn new stuff and on it's way I implement it in my own style. 
- ☮ My side activities: 🎨♟🎧🌐
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the things that I don't know.
- 😄 Pronouns: He would be fine.
- ⚡ Fun fact: The QWERTY keyboard layout was designed to slow you down.

### 🔰 While you are still here have a look at some random quotes
*It changes every day*

<!-- BLOG-POST-LIST:START -->
 1.  "Here and there, human nature may be great in times of trial; but generally speaking, it is its weakness and not its strength that appears in a sick chamber: it is selfishness and impatience rather than generosity and fortitude, that one hears of. There is so little real friendship in the world! and unfortunately, there are so many who forget to think seriously till it is almost too late." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Jane Austen</i> 

 2.  "Never regret something that once made you smile." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Amber Deckers</i> 

 3.  "It is the unknown we fear when we look upon death and darkness, nothing more." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by J. K. Rowling</i> 

 4.  "Family isn't about whose blood you have. It's about who you care about." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Trey Parker and Matt Stone</i>
