# **_ Hi, you have reached at Mahesh's GitHub profile _**
### 🌸 About me ?
I am INFJ-A, most of the time. Having a discussion about human psychology, count me in, apart from that I am interested in Science, The Universe, and all other super cool stuff including Aliens 🤫. Just like the rest I am also a CS engineer, I try to learn new stuff and on it's way I implement it in my own style. 
- ☮ My side activities: 🎨♟🎧🌐
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the things that I don't know.
- 😄 Pronouns: He would be fine.
- ⚡ Fun fact: The QWERTY keyboard layout was designed to slow you down.
