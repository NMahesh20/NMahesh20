# **_ Hi, you have reached at Mahesh's GitHub profile _**
### 🌸 About me ?
I am INFJ-A, most of the time. Having a discussion about human psychology, count me in, apart from that I am interested in Science, The Universe, and all other super cool stuff including Aliens 🤫. Just like the rest I am also a CS engineer, I try to learn new stuff and on it's way I implement it in my own style. 
- ☮ My side activities: 🎨♟🎧🌐
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the things that I don't know.
- 😄 Pronouns: He would be fine.
- ⚡ Fun fact: The QWERTY keyboard layout was designed to slow you down.

 2.  "I tore myself away from the safe comfort of certainties through my love for the truth; and truth rewarded me." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Simone de Beauvoir</i>

 4.  "The animals of the planet are in desperate peril... Without free animal life I believe we will lose the spiritual equivalent of oxygen." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Alice Walker</i>
