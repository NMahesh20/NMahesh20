# **_ Hi, you have reached at Mahesh's GitHub profile _**
### 🌸 About me ?
I am INFJ-A, most of the time. Having a discussion about human psychology, count me in, apart from that I am interested in Science, The Universe, and all other super cool stuff including Aliens 🤫. Just like the rest I am also a CS engineer, I try to learn new stuff and on it's way I implement it in my own style. 
- ☮ My side activities: 🎨♟🎧🌐
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the things that I don't know.
- 😄 Pronouns: He would be fine.
- ⚡ Fun fact: The QWERTY keyboard layout was designed to slow you down.

*It changes every day*

<!-- BLOG-POST-LIST:START -->
 1.  "Whatever you do, do it to the purpose; do it thoroughly, not superficially. Go to the bottom of things. Any thing half done, or half known, is in my mind, neither done nor known at all. Nay, worse, for it often misleads." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Lord Chesterfield</i> 

 2.  "The power of illustrative anecdotes often lies not in how well they present reality, but in how well they reflect the core beliefs of their audience." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by David P. Mikkelson</i> 

 3.  "You must lose a fly to catch a trout." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by George Herbert</i> 

 4.  "When we lose one we love, our bitterest tears are called forth by the memory of hours when we loved not enough." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Maurice Maeterlinck</i>
