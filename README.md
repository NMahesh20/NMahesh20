### 🌸 About me ?
I am INFJ-A, most of the time. Having a discussion about human psychology, count me in, apart from that I am interested in Science, The Universe, and all other super cool stuff including Aliens 🤫. Just like the rest I am also a CS engineer, I try to learn new stuff and on it's way I implement it in my own style. 
- ☮ My side activities: 🎨♟🎧🌐
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the things that I don't know.
- 😄 Pronouns: He would be fine.
- ⚡ Fun fact: The QWERTY keyboard layout was designed to slow you down.

*It changes every day*

<!-- BLOG-POST-LIST:START -->
 1.  "And since, in our passage through this world, painful circumstances occur more frequently than pleasing ones, and since our sense of evil is, I fear, more acute than our sense of good, we become the victims of our feelings, unless we can in some degree command them." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Ann Radcliffe</i> 

 2.  "He makes people pleased with him by making them first pleased with themselves." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Lord Chesterfield</i> 

 3.  "Emergencies have always been necessary to progress. It was darkness which produced the lamp. It was fog that produced the compass. It was hunger that drove us to exploration. And it took a depression to teach us the real value of a job." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Victor Hugo</i> 

 4.  "When we lose one we love, our bitterest tears are called forth by the memory of hours when we loved not enough." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Maurice Maeterlinck</i>
