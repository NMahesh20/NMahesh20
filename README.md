# **_ Hi, you have reached at Mahesh's GitHub profile _**
### 🌸 About me ?
I am INFJ-A, most of the time. Having a discussion about human psychology, count me in, apart from that I am interested in Science, The Universe, and all other super cool stuff including Aliens 🤫. Just like the rest I am also a CS engineer, I try to learn new stuff and on it's way I implement it in my own style. 
- ☮ My side activities: 🎨♟🎧🌐
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the things that I don't know.
- 😄 Pronouns: He would be fine
- ⚡ Fun fact: Did you know that the center of the Donut is 100% fat free

### 🔰 While you are still here have a look at some random quotes
*It changes every day*

<!-- BLOG-POST-LIST:START -->
 1.  "Eccentricity is not, as dull people would have us believe, a form of madness. It is often a kind of innocent pride, and the man of genius and the aristocrat are frequently regarded as eccentrics because genius and aristocrat are entirely unafraid of and uninfluenced by the opinions and vagaries of the crowd." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Edith Sitwell</i> 

 2.  "A single day is enough to make us a little larger." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Paul Klee</i> 

 3.  "The trick is to make sure you don't die waiting for prosperity to come." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Lee Iacocca</i> 

 4.  "Life is just a mirror, and what you see out there, you must first see inside of you." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Wally 'Famous' Amos</i>
