# **_ Hi, you have reached at Mahesh's GitHub profile _**
### 🌸 About me ?
I am INFJ-A, most of the time. Having a discussion about human psychology, count me in, apart from that I am interested in Science, The Universe, and all other super cool stuff including Aliens 🤫. Just like the rest I am also a CS engineer, I try to learn new stuff and on it's way I implement it in my own style. 
- ☮ My side activities: 🎨♟🎧🌐
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the things that I don't know.
- 😄 Pronouns: He would be fine.
- ⚡ Fun fact: The QWERTY keyboard layout was designed to slow you down.

 1.  "I'm not judging people, I'm judging their actions. It's the same type of distinction that I try to apply to myself, to judge, but not be judgmental." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Jeff Melvoin</i> 

 2.  "I hear and I forget. I see and I remember. I do and I understand." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Confucius</i> 

 3.  "Make it a rule of life never to regret and never to look back. Regret is an appalling waste of energy; you can't build on it; it's only for wallowing in." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Katherine Mansfield</i> 

 4.  "Things are seldom what they seem, skim milk masquerades as cream." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by W. S. Gilbert</i>
