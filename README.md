# **_ Hi, you have reached at Mahesh's GitHub profile _**
### 🌸 About me ?
I am INFJ-A, most of the time. Having a discussion about human psychology, count me in, apart from that I am interested in Science, The Universe, and all other super cool stuff including Aliens 🤫. Just like the rest I am also a CS engineer, I try to learn new stuff and on it's way I implement it in my own style. 
- ☮ My side activities: 🎨♟🎧🌐
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the things that I don't know.
- 😄 Pronouns: He would be fine.
- ⚡ Fun fact: The QWERTY keyboard layout was designed to slow you down.

### 🔰 While you are still here have a look at some random quotes
*It changes every day*

<!-- BLOG-POST-LIST:START -->
 1.  "The first rule of life is to reveal nothing, to be exceptionally cautious in what you say, in whatever company you may find yourself. If you have a secret, you have only to whisper it to your dearest friend with the strictest injunction that it will go no further, and within half a day the story is all over town, and when you do make what would seem to be a perfectly sensible remark, you will find it reported in the most grotesque form, thus incurring no end of criticism to rebound upon you." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Elizabeth Aston</i> 

 2.  "Great ability develops and reveals itself increasingly with every new assignment." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Baltasar Gracian</i> 

 3.  "We live in a time of transition, an uneasy era which is likely to endure for the rest of this century. During the period we may be tempted to abandon some of the time-honored principles and commitments which have been proven during the difficult times of past generations. We must never yield to this temptation. Our American values are not luxuries, but necessities - not the salt in our bread, but the bread itself." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Jimmy Carter</i> 

 4.  "The Argument from Intimidation is a confession of intellectual impotence." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Ayn Rand</i>
