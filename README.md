# **_ Hi, you have reached Mahesh's GitHub profile _**
### 🌸 About me ?
My persona falls under INFJ-A, or as per the <a href="https://bigfive-test.com/result/692c68083b5a3f3f12dd9937"> Big-5 metrics</a>. Having a discussion about human psychology, count me in. Apart from that, I am also interested in Science, the Universe, and all other super cool stuff, including Aliens 🤫. Just like the rest, I am also a CS engineer. I try to learn new stuff, and on the way, I implement it in my own style. 
- ☮ My side activities: 🎨♟🎧🌐
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the things that I don't know.
- 😄 Pronouns: He would be fine.
- ⚡ Fun fact: The QWERTY keyboard layout was designed to slow you down.

<!-- BLOG-POST-LIST:START -->
 1.  "If you were to go [to the Rijksmuseum], and hopefully someday you will, you would see a lot of paintings of dead people. You'd see Jesus on the cross, and you'd see a dude getting stabbed in the neck, and you'd see people dying at sea and in battle and a parade of martyrs. But Not. One. Single. Cancer. Kid. Nobody biting it from the plague or smallpox or yellow fever or whatever, because there is no glory in illness. There is no meaning to it. There is no honor in dying of." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by John Green</i> 

 2.  "Know most of the rooms of thy native country before thou goest over the threshold thereof." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Thomas Fuller</i> 

 3.  "Art enables us to find ourselves and lose ourselves at the same time." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Thomas Merton</i> 

 4.  "I never feel age...If you have creative work, you don't have age or time." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Louise Nevelson</i>
