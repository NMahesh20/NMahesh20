# **_ Hi, you have reached at Mahesh's GitHub profile _**
### 🌸 About me ?
I am INFJ-A, most of the time. Having a discussion about human psychology, count me in, apart from that I am interested in Science, The Universe, and all other super cool stuff including Aliens 🤫. Just like the rest I am also a CS engineer, I try to learn new stuff and on it's way I implement it in my own style. 
- ☮ My side activities: 🎨♟🎧🌐
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the things that I don't know.
- 😄 Pronouns: He would be fine.
- ⚡ Fun fact: The QWERTY keyboard layout was designed to slow you down.

### 🔰 While you are still here have a look at some random quotes
*It changes every day*

<!-- BLOG-POST-LIST:START -->
 1.  "We can aspire to anything, but we don't get it just 'cause we want it. I would rather spend my life close to the birds than waste it wishing I had wings." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Eli Attie</i> 

 2.  "Today is the day in which to express your noblest qualities of mind and heart, to do at least one worthy thing which you have long postponed." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Grenville Kleiser</i> 

 3.  "The only way to last a really long time is to build something useful enough that people will want to keep it going after you die, and to cultivate a sense of ownership in other people. In short: make good shit and give it away as fast as you can." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Lisa Williams</i> 

 4.  "It is easier to exclude harmful passions than to rule them, and to deny them admittance than to control them after they have been admitted." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Seneca</i>
