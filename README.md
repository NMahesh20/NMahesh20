# **_ Hi, you have reached at Mahesh's GitHub profile _**
### 🌸 About me ?
I am INFJ-A, most of the time. Having a discussion about human psychology, count me in, apart from that I am interested in Science, The Universe, and all other super cool stuff including Aliens 🤫. Just like the rest I am also a CS engineer, I try to learn new stuff and on it's way I implement it in my own style. 
- ☮ My side activities: 🎨♟🎧🌐
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the things that I don't know.
- 😄 Pronouns: He would be fine.
- ⚡ Fun fact: The QWERTY keyboard layout was designed to slow you down.

### 🔰 While you are still here have a look at some random quotes
*It changes every day*

<!-- BLOG-POST-LIST:START -->
 1.  "Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life. Don't be trapped by dogma - which is living with the results of other people's thinking. Don't let the noise of other's opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Steve Jobs</i> 

 2.  "We learn and grow and are transformed not so much by what we do but by why and how we do it." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Sharon Salzberg</i> 

 3.  "There can be no spirituality, no sanctity, no truth without the female sex." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Diane Frolov and Andrew Schneider</i> 

 4.  "He that respects himself is safe from others. He wears a coat of mail that none can pierce." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow</i>
