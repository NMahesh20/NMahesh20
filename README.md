### 🌸 About me ?
I am INFJ-A, most of the time. Having a discussion about human psychology, count me in, apart from that I am interested in Science, The Universe, and all other super cool stuff including Aliens 🤫. Just like the rest I am also a CS engineer, I try to learn new stuff and on it's way I implement it in my own style. 
- ☮ My side activities: 🎨♟🎧🌐
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the things that I don't know.
- 😄 Pronouns: He would be fine
- ⚡ Fun fact: Did you know that the center of the Donut is 100% fat free

### 🔰 While you are still here have a look at some random quotes
*It changes every day*

 1.  "I would rather spend an hour among the notorious than two minutes with the dull." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Stephanie Barron</i> 

 2.  "What counts is not necessarily the size of the dog in the fight - it's the size of the fight in the dog." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Dwight D. Eisenhower</i> 

 3.  "Before you begin a thing, remind yourself that difficulties and delays quite impossible to foresee are ahead. If you could see them clearly, naturally you could do a great deal to get rid of them but you can't. You can only see one thing clearly and that is your goal. Form a mental vision of that and cling to it through thick and thin." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Kathleen Norris</i> 

 4.  "Plans are only good intentions unless they immediately degenerate into hard work." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Peter Drucker</i>
