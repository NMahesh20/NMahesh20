# **_ Hi, you have reached Mahesh's GitHub profile _**
### 🌸 About me ?
My persona falls under INFJ-A, or as per the <a href="https://bigfive-test.com/result/692c68083b5a3f3f12dd9937"> Big-5 metrics</a>. Having a discussion about human psychology, count me in. Apart from that, I am also interested in Science, the Universe, and all other super cool stuff, including Aliens 🤫. Just like the rest, I am also a CS engineer. I try to learn new stuff, and on the way, I implement it in my own style. 
- ☮ My side activities: 🎨♟🎧🌐
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the things that I don't know.
- 😄 Pronouns: He would be fine.
- ⚡ Fun fact: The QWERTY keyboard layout was designed to slow you down.

*It changes every day*

<!-- BLOG-POST-LIST:START -->
 1.  "It is impossible to go through life without trust: That is to be imprisoned in the worst cell of all, oneself." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Graham Greene</i> 

 2.  "Death is a friend of ours; and he that is not ready to entertain him is not at home." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Sir Francis Bacon</i> 

 3.  "My mother drew a distinction between achievement and success. She said that 'achievement is the knowledge that you have studied and worked hard and done the best that is in you. Success is being praised by others, and that's nice, too, but not as important or satisfying. Always aim for achievement and forget about success.'" <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Helen Hayes</i> 

 4.  "I happen to feel that the degree of a person's intelligence is directly reflected by the number of conflicting attitudes she can bring to bear on the same topic." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Lisa Alther</i>
