### 🌸 About me ?
I am INFJ-A, most of the time. Having a discussion about human psychology, count me in, apart from that I am interested in Science, The Universe, and all other super cool stuff including Aliens 🤫. Just like the rest I am also a CS engineer, I try to learn new stuff and on it's way I implement it in my own style. 
- ☮ My side activities: 🎨♟🎧🌐
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the things that I don't know.
- 😄 Pronouns: He would be fine.
- ⚡ Fun fact: The QWERTY keyboard layout was designed to slow you down.

### 🔰 While you are still here have a look at some random quotes
*It changes every day*

<!-- BLOG-POST-LIST:START -->
 1.  "The aim of life is self-development. To realize one's nature perfectly - that is what each of us is here for." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Oscar Wilde</i> 

 2.  "When the conduct of men is designed to be influenced, persuasion, kind unassuming persuasion, should ever be adopted. It is an old and true maxim that 'a drop of honey catches more flies than a gallon of gall.' So with men. If you would win a man to your cause, first convince him that you are his sincere friend. Therein is a drop of honey that catches his heart, which, say what he will, is the great highroad to his reason, and which, once gained, you will find but little trouble in convincing him of the justice of your cause, if indeed that cause is really a good one." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Abraham Lincoln</i> 

 3.  "The thing always happens that you really believe in; and the belief in a thing makes it happen." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Frank Lloyd Wright</i> 

 4.  "There are some things you learn best in calm, and some in storm." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Willa Cather</i>
