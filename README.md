# **_ Hi, you have reached at Mahesh's GitHub profile _**
### 🌸 About me ?
I am INFJ-A, most of the time. Having a discussion about human psychology, count me in, apart from that I am interested in Science, The Universe, and all other super cool stuff including Aliens 🤫. Just like the rest I am also a CS engineer, I try to learn new stuff and on it's way I implement it in my own style. 
- ☮ My side activities: 🎨♟🎧🌐
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the things that I don't know.
- 😄 Pronouns: He would be fine.
- ⚡ Fun fact: The QWERTY keyboard layout was designed to slow you down.

*It changes every day*

<!-- BLOG-POST-LIST:START -->
 1.  "We have been told we cannot do this by a chorus of cynics. They will only grow louder and more dissonant in the weeks to come. We've been asked to pause for a reality check; we've been warned against offering the people of this nation false hope. But in the unlikely story that is America, there has never been anything false about hope." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Barack Obama</i> 

 2.  "It is fortunate to be of high birth, but it is no less so to be of such character that people do not care to know whether you are or are not." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Jean de la Bruyere</i> 

 3.  "I think people want their illusions and writers are mostly illusion. When you read their words, you read a flattened, incomplete version of the writer." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Gordon Atkinson</i> 

 4.  "You try to give away what you want yourself." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Lois McMaster Bujold</i>
