### 🌸 About me ?
I am INFJ-A, most of the time. Having a discussion about human psychology, count me in, apart from that I am interested in Science, The Universe, and all other super cool stuff including Aliens 🤫. Just like the rest I am also a CS engineer, I try to learn new stuff and on it's way I implement it in my own style. 
- ☮ My side activities: 🎨♟🎧🌐
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the things that I don't know.
- 😄 Pronouns: He would be fine
- ⚡ Fun fact: Did you know that the center of the Donut is 100% fat free

### 🔰 While you are still here have a look at some random quotes
*It changes every day*

<!-- BLOG-POST-LIST:START -->
 1.  "But all endings are also beginnings. We just don't know it at the time." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Mitch Albom</i> 

 2.  "It's very hard to take yourself too seriously when you look at the world from outer space." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Thomas K. Mattingly II</i> 

 3.  "The reason most people never reach their goals is that they don't define them, or ever seriously consider them as believable or achievable. Winners can tell you where they are going, what they plan to do along the way, and who will be sharing the adventure with them." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Denis Watley</i> 

 4.  "Millions of words are written annually purporting to tell how to beat the races, whereas the best possible advice on the subject is found in the three monosyllables: 'Do not try.'" <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Dan Parker</i>
