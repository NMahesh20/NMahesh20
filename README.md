# **_ Hi, you have reached at Mahesh's GitHub profile _**
### 🌸 About me ?
I am INFJ-A, most of the time. Having a discussion about human psychology, count me in, apart from that I am interested in Science, The Universe, and all other super cool stuff including Aliens 🤫. Just like the rest I am also a CS engineer, I try to learn new stuff and on it's way I implement it in my own style. 
- ☮ My side activities: 🎨♟🎧🌐
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the things that I don't know.
- 😄 Pronouns: He would be fine.
- ⚡ Fun fact: The QWERTY keyboard layout was designed to slow you down.

*It changes every day*

<!-- BLOG-POST-LIST:START -->
 1.  "Gaining control over your health and well-being is one of those times in your life that you get to be completely selfish and not feel bad about it. If you want to meet your goals, you have to make it about you. You have to make it work for you and you alone. Anything less is a setup for failure." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Jennifer Hudson</i> 

 2.  "It's not about vein' mad at everything. It's about bein' REALLY mad at the right stuff." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Ice T.</i> 

 3.  "The only way most people recognize their limits is by trespassing on them." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Tom Morris</i> 

 4.  "One ought, every day at least, to hear a little song, read a good poem, see a fine picture, and if it were possible, to speak a few reasonable words." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe</i>
