# **_ Hi, you have reached at Mahesh's GitHub profile _**
### 🌸 About me ?
I am INFJ-A, most of the time. Having a discussion about human psychology, count me in, apart from that I am interested in Science, The Universe, and all other super cool stuff including Aliens 🤫. Just like the rest I am also a CS engineer, I try to learn new stuff and on it's way I implement it in my own style. 
- ☮ My side activities: 🎨♟🎧🌐
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the things that I don't know.
- 😄 Pronouns: He would be fine.
- ⚡ Fun fact: The QWERTY keyboard layout was designed to slow you down.

 1.  "I know that our bodies were made to thrive only in pure air, and the scenes in which pure air is found. There is not a "fragment" in all nature, for every relative fragment of one thing is a full harmonious unit in itself." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by John Muir</i> 

 2.  "On a long enough timeline. The survival rate for everyone drops to zero." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Chuck Palahniuk</i> 

 3.  "Be wise with speed . A fool at forty is a fool indeed." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Edward Young</i> 

 4.  "Pleasure is a by-product of doing something that is worth doing. Therefore, do not seek pleasure as such. Pleasure comes of seeking something else, and comes by the way." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by A. Lawrence Lowell</i>
