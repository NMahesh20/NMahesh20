# **_ Hi, you have reached at Mahesh's GitHub profile _**
### 🌸 About me ?
I am INFJ-A, most of the time. Having a discussion about human psychology, count me in, apart from that I am interested in Science, The Universe, and all other super cool stuff including Aliens 🤫. Just like the rest I am also a CS engineer, I try to learn new stuff and on it's way I implement it in my own style. 
- ☮ My side activities: 🎨♟🎧🌐
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the things that I don't know.
- 😄 Pronouns: He would be fine.
- ⚡ Fun fact: The QWERTY keyboard layout was designed to slow you down.

 1.  "Personal happiness lies in knowing that life is not a checklist of acquisition or achievement. Your qualifications are not your life." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by J. K. Rowling</i> 

 2.  "Maybe I wanted to hear it so badly that my ears betrayed my mind in order to secure my heart." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Margaret Cho</i> 

 3.  "We're not talking about historical accuracy, we're talking about art. I've set in motion a geometric inevitability. If I start chiseling there, chipping here, the whole form is compromised." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by David Assael</i> 

 4.  "The spirit in which a thing is given determines that in which the debt is acknowledged; it's the intention, not the face-value of the gift, that's weighed." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Seneca</i>
