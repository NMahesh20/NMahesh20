# **_ Hi, you have reached Mahesh's GitHub profile _**
### 🌸 About me ?
My persona falls under INFJ-A, or as per the <a href="https://bigfive-test.com/result/692c68083b5a3f3f12dd9937"> Big-5 metrics</a>. Having a discussion about human psychology, count me in. Apart from that, I am also interested in Science, the Universe, and all other super cool stuff, including Aliens 🤫. Just like the rest, I am also a CS engineer. I try to learn new stuff, and on the way, I implement it in my own style. 
- ☮ My side activities: 🎨♟🎧🌐
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the things that I don't know.
- 😄 Pronouns: He would be fine.
- ⚡ Fun fact: The QWERTY keyboard layout was designed to slow you down.

### 🔰 While you are still here, have a look at some random quotes
*It changes every day*

<!-- BLOG-POST-LIST:START -->
 1.  "No one can be right all of the time, but it helps to be right most of the time." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Robert Half</i> 

 2.  "Son, always tell the truth. Then you'll never have to remember what you said the last time." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Sam Rayburn</i> 

 3.  "This art of resting the mind and the power of dismissing from it all care and worry is probably one of the secrets of energy in our great men." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Captain J. A. Hadfield</i> 

 4.  "Don't be discouraged by a failure. It can be a positive experience. Failure is, in a sense, the highway to success, inasmuch as every discovery of what is false leads us to seek earnestly after what is true, and every fresh experience points out some form of error which we shall afterwards carefully avoid." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by John Keats</i>
