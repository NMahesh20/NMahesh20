# **_ Hi, you have reached at Mahesh's GitHub profile _**
### 🌸 About me ?
I am INFJ-A, most of the time. Having a discussion about human psychology, count me in, apart from that I am interested in Science, The Universe, and all other super cool stuff including Aliens 🤫. Just like the rest I am also a CS engineer, I try to learn new stuff and on it's way I implement it in my own style. 
- ☮ My side activities: 🎨♟🎧🌐
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the things that I don't know.
- 😄 Pronouns: He would be fine
- ⚡ Fun fact: Did you know that the center of the Donut is 100% fat free

### 🔰 While you are still here have a look at some random quotes
*It changes every day*

<!-- BLOG-POST-LIST:START -->
 1.  "Fasting and natural diet, though essentially unknown [in today's U.S.] as a therapy, should be the first treatment when someone discovers that she or he has a medical problem. It should not be applied only to the most advanced cases, as is present practice. Whether the patient has a cardiac condition, hypertension, autoimmune disease, fibroids, or asthma, he or she must be informed that fasting and natural, plant-based diets are a viable alternative to conventional therapy, and an effective one. The time may come when not offering this substantially more effective nutritional approach will be considered malpractice." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Joel Fuhrman, M.D.</i> 

 2.  "Every time you don't follow your inner guidance, you feel a loss of energy, loss of power, a sense of spiritual deadness." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Shakti Gawain</i> 

 3.  "Keep true to the dreams of thy youth." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Friedrich von Schiller</i> 

 4.  "Despise not any man, and do not spurn anything; for there is no man who has not his hour, nor is there anything that has not its place." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Ben Azai</i>
