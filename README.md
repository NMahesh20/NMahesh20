# **_ Hi, you have reached at Mahesh's GitHub profile _**
### 🌸 About me ?
I am INFJ-A, most of the time. Having a discussion about human psychology, count me in, apart from that I am interested in Science, The Universe, and all other super cool stuff including Aliens 🤫. Just like the rest I am also a CS engineer, I try to learn new stuff and on it's way I implement it in my own style. 
- ☮ My side activities: 🎨♟🎧🌐
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the things that I don't know.
- 😄 Pronouns: He would be fine.
- ⚡ Fun fact: The QWERTY keyboard layout was designed to slow you down.

### 🔰 While you are still here have a look at some random quotes
*It changes every day*

<!-- BLOG-POST-LIST:START -->
 1.  "We spend most of our time and energy in a kind of horizontal thinking. We move along the surface of things [but] there are times when we stop. We sit still. We lose ourselves in a pile of leaves or its memory. We listen and breezes from a whole other world begin to whisper." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by James Carroll</i> 

 2.  "Never bear more than one trouble at a time. Some people bear three kinds - all they have had, all they have now, and all they expect to have." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Edward Everett Hale</i> 

 3.  "There is only one success - to be able to spend your life in your own way." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Christopher Morley</i> 

 4.  "You can have anything you want if you want it desperately enough. You must want it with an inner exuberance that erupts through the skin and joins the energy that created the world." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Sheila Graham</i>
