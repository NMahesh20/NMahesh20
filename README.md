### 🔰 While you are still here have a look at some random quotes
*It changes every day*

<!-- BLOG-POST-LIST:START -->
 1.  "Moments of kindness and reconciliation are worth having, even if the parting has to come sooner or later." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Alice Munro</i> 

 2.  "Acceptance is not a state of passivity or inaction. I am not saying you can't change the world, right wrongs, or replace evil with good. Acceptance is, in fact, the first step to successful action. If you don't fully accept a situation precisely the way it is, you will have difficulty changing it. Moreover, if you don't fully accept the situation, you will never really know if the situation should be changed." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Peter McWilliams</i> 

 3.  "The superior man, when resting in safety, does not forget that danger may come. When in a state of security he does not forget the possibility of ruin. When all is orderly, he does not forget that disorder may come. Thus his person is not endangered, and his States and all their clans are preserved." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Confucius</i> 

 4.  "The love of learning, the sequestered nooks,/ And all the sweet serenity of books." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow</i>
