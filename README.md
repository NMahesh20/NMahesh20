# **_ Hi, you have reached at Mahesh's GitHub profile _**
### 🌸 About me ?
I am INFJ-A, most of the time. Having a discussion about human psychology, count me in, apart from that I am interested in Science, The Universe, and all other super cool stuff including Aliens 🤫. Just like the rest I am also a CS engineer, I try to learn new stuff and on it's way I implement it in my own style. 
- ☮ My side activities: 🎨♟🎧🌐
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the things that I don't know.
- 😄 Pronouns: He would be fine.
- ⚡ Fun fact: The QWERTY keyboard layout was designed to slow you down.

### 🔰 While you are still here have a look at some random quotes
*It changes every day*

<!-- BLOG-POST-LIST:START -->
 1.  "I think it would be worse to expect nothing than to be disappointed." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by L. M. Montgomery</i> 

 2.  "You can approach the act of writing with nervousness, excitement, hopefulness, or even despair–the sense that you can never completely put on the page what’s in your mind and heart. You can come to the act with your fists clenched and your eyes narrowed, ready to kick ass and take down names. You can come to it because you want a girl to marry you or because you want to change the world. Come to it any way but lightly. Let me say it again: you must not come lightly to the blank page." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Stephen King</i> 

 3.  "The vitality of thought is in adventure. Ideas won't keep. Something must be done about them." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Alfred North Whitehead</i> 

 4.  "Believe nothing against another but on good authority; and never report what may hurt another, unless it be a greater hurt to some other to conceal it." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by William Penn</i>
