# **_ Hi, you have reached at Mahesh's GitHub profile _**
### 🌸 About me ?
I am INFJ-A, most of the time. Having a discussion about human psychology, count me in, apart from that I am interested in Science, The Universe, and all other super cool stuff including Aliens 🤫. Just like the rest I am also a CS engineer, I try to learn new stuff and on it's way I implement it in my own style. 
- ☮ My side activities: 🎨♟🎧🌐
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the things that I don't know.
- 😄 Pronouns: He would be fine.
- ⚡ Fun fact: The QWERTY keyboard layout was designed to slow you down.

### 🔰 While you are still here have a look at some random quotes
*It changes every day*

<!-- BLOG-POST-LIST:START -->
 1.  "It gets a lot easier to deal with life's curveballs when you're not hiding under layers of fat." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Ali Vincent</i> 

 2.  "Acceptance is not a state of passivity or inaction. I am not saying you can't change the world, right wrongs, or replace evil with good. Acceptance is, in fact, the first step to successful action. If you don't fully accept a situation precisely the way it is, you will have difficulty changing it. Moreover, if you don't fully accept the situation, you will never really know if the situation should be changed." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Peter McWilliams</i> 

 3.  "If all the year were playing holidays, /To sport would be as tedious as to work." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by William Shakespeare</i> 

 4.  "A good name, like good will, is got by many actions and lost by one." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Lord Jeffery</i>
