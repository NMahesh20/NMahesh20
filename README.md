# **_ Hi, you have reached at Mahesh's GitHub profile _**
### 🌸 About me ?
I am INFJ-A, most of the time. Having a discussion about human psychology, count me in, apart from that I am interested in Science, The Universe, and all other super cool stuff including Aliens 🤫. Just like the rest I am also a CS engineer, I try to learn new stuff and on it's way I implement it in my own style. 
- ☮ My side activities: 🎨♟🎧🌐
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the things that I don't know.
- 😄 Pronouns: He would be fine.
- ⚡ Fun fact: The QWERTY keyboard layout was designed to slow you down.

### 🔰 While you are still here have a look at some random quotes
*It changes every day*

<!-- BLOG-POST-LIST:START -->
 1.  "I didn't mind getting old when I was young. It's the being old now that's getting to me." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by John Scalzi</i> 

 2.  "The man least dependent upon the morrow goes to meet the morrow most cheerfully." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Epicurus</i> 

 3.  "Don't be discouraged by a failure. It can be a positive experience. Failure is, in a sense, the highway to success, inasmuch as every discovery of what is false leads us to seek earnestly after what is true, and every fresh experience points out some form of error which we shall afterwards carefully avoid." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by John Keats</i> 

 4.  "Purchase not friends by gifts; when thou ceasest to give, such will cease to love." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Thomas Fuller</i>
