### 🔰 While you are still here have a look at some random quotes
*It changes every day*

<!-- BLOG-POST-LIST:START -->
 1.  "" <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Buddha</i> 

 2.  "There are an awful lot of scientists today who believe that before very long we shall have unraveled all the secrets of the universe. There will be no puzzles anymore. To me it'd be really, really tragic because I think one of the most exciting things is this feeling of mystery, feeling of awe, the feeling of looking at a little live thing and being amazed by it and how its emerged through these hundreds of years of evolution and there it is and it is perfect and why." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Jane Goodall</i> 

 3.  "Throw out an alarming alarm clock. If the ring is loud and strident, you're waking up to instant stress. You shouldn't be bullied out of bed, just reminded that it's time to start your day." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Sharon Gold</i> 

 4.  "The best way to convince a fool that he is wrong is to let him have his own way." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Josh Billings</i>
