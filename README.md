# **_ Hi, you have reached at Mahesh's GitHub profile _**
### 🌸 About me ?
I am INFJ-A, most of the time. Having a discussion about human psychology, count me in, apart from that I am interested in Science, The Universe, and all other super cool stuff including Aliens 🤫. Just like the rest I am also a CS engineer, I try to learn new stuff and on it's way I implement it in my own style. 
- ☮ My side activities: 🎨♟🎧🌐
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the things that I don't know.
- 😄 Pronouns: He would be fine.
- ⚡ Fun fact: The QWERTY keyboard layout was designed to slow you down.

<!-- BLOG-POST-LIST:START -->
 1.  "Sometimes, a person who likes your work and a person who don’t will show up within milliseconds of each other to let you know how they feel. One does not need to cancel out the other, positively or negatively; if you’re proud of the work, and you enjoyed the work, that is what’s important." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Wil Wheaton</i> 

 2.  "Making excuses is not going to get me any closer to my goals." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Ali Vincent</i> 

 3.  "It's all knowing what to start with. If you start in the right place and follow all the steps, you will get to the right end." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Elizabeth Moon</i> 

 4.  "A harbor, even if it is a little harbor, is a good thing... It takes something from the world, and has something to give in return." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Sarah Orne Jewett</i>
