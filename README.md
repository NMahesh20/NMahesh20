# **_ Hi, you have reached at Mahesh's GitHub profile _**
### 🌸 About me ?
I am INFJ-A, most of the time. Having a discussion about human psychology, count me in, apart from that I am interested in Science, The Universe, and all other super cool stuff including Aliens 🤫. Just like the rest I am also a CS engineer, I try to learn new stuff and on it's way I implement it in my own style. 
- ☮ My side activities: 🎨♟🎧🌐
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the things that I don't know.
- 😄 Pronouns: He would be fine
- ⚡ Fun fact: Did you know that the center of the Donut is 100% fat free

### 🔰 While you are still here have a look at some random quotes
*It changes every day*

<!-- BLOG-POST-LIST:START -->
 1.  "My parents taught me how to listen to everybody before I made up my own mind. When you listen, you learn. You absorb like a sponge-and your life becomes so much better than when you are just trying to be listened to all the time." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Steven Spielberg</i> 

 2.  "Indifference and neglect often do much more damage than outright dislike." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by J. K. Rowling</i> 

 3.  "I cannot live without books." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Thomas Jefferson</i> 

 4.  "Call it a clan, call it a network, call it a tribe, call it a family. Whatever you call it, whoever you are, you need one." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Jane Howard</i>
