# **_ Hi, you have reached at Mahesh's GitHub profile _**
### 🌸 About me ?
I am INFJ-A, most of the time. Having a discussion about human psychology, count me in, apart from that I am interested in Science, The Universe, and all other super cool stuff including Aliens 🤫. Just like the rest I am also a CS engineer, I try to learn new stuff and on it's way I implement it in my own style. 
- ☮ My side activities: 🎨♟🎧🌐
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the things that I don't know.
- 😄 Pronouns: He would be fine.
- ⚡ Fun fact: The QWERTY keyboard layout was designed to slow you down.

<!-- BLOG-POST-LIST:START -->
 1.  "The best way to try to motivate somebody is by being direct with them. To be honest with them. Lies are never the right way to get your message across." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Trey Parker and Matt Stone</i> 

 2.  "" <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Hugh Macleod</i> 

 3.  "Remember! Things in life will not always run smoothly. Sometimes we will be rising toward the heights - then all will seem to reverse itself and start downward. The great fact to remember is that the trend of civilization itself is forever upward, that a line drawn through the middle of the peaks and the valleys of the centuries always has an upward trend." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Endicott Peabody</i> 

 4.  "Do not envy a sinner; you don't know what disaster awaits him." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Bible</i>
