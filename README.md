# **_ Hi, you have reached at Mahesh's GitHub profile _**
### 🌸 About me ?
I am INFJ-A, most of the time. Having a discussion about human psychology, count me in, apart from that I am interested in Science, The Universe, and all other super cool stuff including Aliens 🤫. Just like the rest I am also a CS engineer, I try to learn new stuff and on it's way I implement it in my own style. 
- ☮ My side activities: 🎨♟🎧🌐
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the things that I don't know.
- 😄 Pronouns: He would be fine.
- ⚡ Fun fact: The QWERTY keyboard layout was designed to slow you down.

*It changes every day*

<!-- BLOG-POST-LIST:START -->
 1.  "No synonym for God is so perfect as Beauty. Whether as seen carving the lines of the mountains with glaciers, or gathering matter into stars, or planning the movements of water, or gardening - still all is Beauty!" <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by John Muir</i> 

 2.  "That consciousness is everything and that all things begin with a thought. That we are responsible for our own fate, we reap what we sow, we get what we give, we pull in what we put out. I know these things for sure." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Madonna</i> 

 3.  "Some think it's holding on that makes one strong; sometimes it's letting go." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Sylvia Robinson</i> 

 4.  "A good home must be made, not bought." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Joyce Maynard</i>
