# **_ Hi, you have reached at Mahesh's GitHub profile _**
### 🌸 About me ?
I am INFJ-A, most of the time. Having a discussion about human psychology, count me in, apart from that I am interested in Science, The Universe, and all other super cool stuff including Aliens 🤫. Just like the rest I am also a CS engineer, I try to learn new stuff and on it's way I implement it in my own style. 
- ☮ My side activities: 🎨♟🎧🌐
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the things that I don't know.
- 😄 Pronouns: He would be fine.
- ⚡ Fun fact: The QWERTY keyboard layout was designed to slow you down.

### 🔰 While you are still here have a look at some random quotes
*It changes every day*

<!-- BLOG-POST-LIST:START -->
 1.  "When you understand that your feelings are triggered by what you think about an event and not by the event itself, you gain a measure of control. Although you cannot control the things (events) that happen to you, or change your feelings (after all, you feel the way you feel), you can change your thoughts. A change in thoughts often radically alters your feelings." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Julie A., M.A. Ross and Judy Corcoran</i> 

 2.  "" <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Francis Ford Coppola</i> 

 3.  "You need only claim the event of your life to make yourself yours. When you truly possess all you have been and done, which may take some time, you are fierce with reality." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Florida Scott-Maxwell</i> 

 4.  "Whosoever is delighted in solitude is either a wild beast or a god." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Sir Francis Bacon</i>
