# **_ Hi, you have reached at Mahesh's GitHub profile _**
### 🌸 About me ?
I am INFJ-A, most of the time. Having a discussion about human psychology, count me in, apart from that I am interested in Science, The Universe, and all other super cool stuff including Aliens 🤫. Just like the rest I am also a CS engineer, I try to learn new stuff and on it's way I implement it in my own style. 
- ☮ My side activities: 🎨♟🎧🌐
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the things that I don't know.
- 😄 Pronouns: He would be fine.
- ⚡ Fun fact: The QWERTY keyboard layout was designed to slow you down.

### 🔰 While you are still here have a look at some random quotes
*It changes every day*

<!-- BLOG-POST-LIST:START -->
 1.  "You suffer a lot more hiding something than if you face up to it." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Alexander Woo</i> 

 2.  "Reveal not every secret you have to a friend, for how can you tell but that friend may hereafter become an enemy. And bring not all mischief you are able to upon an enemy, for he may one day become your friend." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Saadi</i> 

 3.  "You must keep sending work out; you must never let a manuscript do nothing but eat its head off in a drawer. You send that work out again and again, while you're working on another one. If you have talent, you will receive some measure of success - but only if you persist." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Isaac Asimov</i> 

 4.  "To find fulfillment...don't exist with life - embrace it." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Jim Beggs</i>
