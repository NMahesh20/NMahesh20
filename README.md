# **_ Hi, you have reached at Mahesh's GitHub profile _**
### 🌸 About me ?
I am INFJ-A, most of the time. Having a discussion about human psychology, count me in, apart from that I am interested in Science, The Universe, and all other super cool stuff including Aliens 🤫. Just like the rest I am also a CS engineer, I try to learn new stuff and on it's way I implement it in my own style. 
- ☮ My side activities: 🎨♟🎧🌐
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the things that I don't know.
- 😄 Pronouns: He would be fine.
- ⚡ Fun fact: The QWERTY keyboard layout was designed to slow you down.

### 🔰 While you are still here have a look at some random quotes
*It changes every day*

<!-- BLOG-POST-LIST:START -->
 1.  "Looking forward to things is half the pleasure of them. You mayn't get the things themselves; but nothing can prevent you from having the fun of looking forward to them." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by L. M. Montgomery</i> 

 2.  "Time present and time past are both perhaps present in time future and time future contained in time past. If all time is eternally present all time is unredeemable." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Swatch</i> 

 3.  "See, that's all you're thinking about, is winning. You're confirming your sense of self- worth through outward reward instead of through inner appreciation." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Barbara Hall</i> 

 4.  "One must not lose desires. They are mighty stimulants to creativeness, to love, and to long life." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Alexander A. Bogomoletz</i>
