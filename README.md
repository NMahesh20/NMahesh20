# **_ Hi, you have reached at Mahesh's GitHub profile _**
### 🌸 About me ?
I am INFJ-A, most of the time. Having a discussion about human psychology, count me in, apart from that I am interested in Science, The Universe, and all other super cool stuff including Aliens 🤫. Just like the rest I am also a CS engineer, I try to learn new stuff and on it's way I implement it in my own style. 
- ☮ My side activities: 🎨♟🎧🌐
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the things that I don't know.
- 😄 Pronouns: He would be fine.
- ⚡ Fun fact: The QWERTY keyboard layout was designed to slow you down.

### 🔰 While you are still here have a look at some random quotes
*It changes every day*

<!-- BLOG-POST-LIST:START -->
 1.  "Before we get too depressed about the state of our politics, let's remember our history. The great debates of the past, all stirred great passions. They all made somebody angry, and at least once led to a terrible war. What is amazing, is that despite all the conflict, our experiment in democracy has worked better than any form of government on earth." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Barack Obama</i> 

 2.  "It's not the will to win that matters...everyone has that. It's the will to prepare to win that matters." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Paul "Bear" Bryant</i> 

 3.  "A successful marriage requires falling in love many times, always with the same person." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Mignon McLaughlin</i> 

 4.  "Eventually, all things merge into one, and a river runs through it. The river was cut by the world's great flood and runs over rocks from the basement of time. On some of the rocks are timeless raindrops. Under the rocks are the words, and some of the words are theirs. I am haunted by waters." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Norman Maclean</i>
