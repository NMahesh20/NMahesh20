# **_ Hi, you have reached at Mahesh's GitHub profile _**
### 🌸 About me ?
I am INFJ-A, most of the time. Having a discussion about human psychology, count me in, apart from that I am interested in Science, The Universe, and all other super cool stuff including Aliens 🤫. Just like the rest I am also a CS engineer, I try to learn new stuff and on it's way I implement it in my own style. 
- ☮ My side activities: 🎨♟🎧🌐
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the things that I don't know.
- 😄 Pronouns: He would be fine.
- ⚡ Fun fact: The QWERTY keyboard layout was designed to slow you down.

<!-- BLOG-POST-LIST:START -->
 1.  "Your whole life people tell you to do what you love. But if you gotta do something else to pay the bills, you don't automatically have to be miserable." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Jeph Jacques</i> 

 2.  "Read at least one book a month. This is self-serving, obviously. It's a proven fact that people who read buy more books than people who don't read. In truth, I wish you'd read ten books a month, or at least buy that many." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Randy Pausch</i> 

 3.  "I take care of my things. After all, those of us as has few things to begin with must take care, lest we have fewer." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Erica Eisdorfer</i> 

 4.  "Tao. Some of us look for the Way in opium and some in God, some of us in whiskey and some in love. It is all the same Way and it leads nowhither." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by W. Somerset Maugham</i>
