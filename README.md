# **_ Hi, you have reached at Mahesh's GitHub profile _**
### 🌸 About me ?
I am INFJ-A, most of the time. Having a discussion about human psychology, count me in, apart from that I am interested in Science, The Universe, and all other super cool stuff including Aliens 🤫. Just like the rest I am also a CS engineer, I try to learn new stuff and on it's way I implement it in my own style. 
- ☮ My side activities: 🎨♟🎧🌐
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the things that I don't know.
- 😄 Pronouns: He would be fine.
- ⚡ Fun fact: The QWERTY keyboard layout was designed to slow you down.

 2.  "When the heart speaks, the mind finds it indecent to object." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Milan Kundera</i> 

 3.  "You must have a room, or a certain hour or so a day, where you don't know what was in the newspapers that morning... a place where you can simply experience and bring forth what you are and what you might be." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Joseph Campbell</i> 

 4.  "Fall seven times, stand up eight." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Japanese Proverb</i>
