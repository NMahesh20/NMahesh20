### 🌸 About me ?
I am INFJ-A, most of the time. Having a discussion about human psychology, count me in, apart from that I am interested in Science, The Universe, and all other super cool stuff including Aliens 🤫. Just like the rest I am also a CS engineer, I try to learn new stuff and on it's way I implement it in my own style. 
- ☮ My side activities: 🎨♟🎧🌐
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the things that I don't know.
- 😄 Pronouns: He would be fine.
- ⚡ Fun fact: The QWERTY keyboard layout was designed to slow you down.

 1.  "To sit in the shade on a fine day, and look upon verdure is the most perfect refreshment." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Jane Austen</i> 

 2.  "Until you make peace with who you are, you'll never be content with what you have." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Doris Mortman</i> 

 3.  "I always remember an epitaph which is in the cemetery at Tombstone, Arizona. It says: 'Here lies Jack Williams. He done his damnedest.' I think that is the greatest epitaph a man can have - When he gives everything that is in him to do the job he has before him. That is all you can ask of him and that is what I have tried to do." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Harry S Truman</i> 

 4.  "Don't be sweet, lest you be eaten up; don't be bitter, lest you be spewed out." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Jewish Proverb</i>
