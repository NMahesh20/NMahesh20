# **_ Hi, you have reached at Mahesh's GitHub profile _**
### 🌸 About me ?
I am INFJ-A, most of the time. Having a discussion about human psychology, count me in, apart from that I am interested in Science, The Universe, and all other super cool stuff including Aliens 🤫. Just like the rest I am also a CS engineer, I try to learn new stuff and on it's way I implement it in my own style. 
- ☮ My side activities: 🎨♟🎧🌐
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the things that I don't know.
- 😄 Pronouns: He would be fine.
- ⚡ Fun fact: The QWERTY keyboard layout was designed to slow you down.

### 🔰 While you are still here have a look at some random quotes
*It changes every day*

<!-- BLOG-POST-LIST:START -->
 1.  "Fresh beauty opens one's eyes wherever it is really seen, but the very abundance and completeness of the common beauty that besets our steps prevents its being absorbed and appreciated. It is a good thing, therefore, to make short excursions now and then to the bottom of the sea among dulse and coral, or up among the clouds on mountain-tops, or in balloons, or even to creep like worms into dark holes and caverns underground, not only to learn something of what is going on in those out-of-the-way places, but to see better what the sun sees on our return to common everyday beauty." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by John Muir</i> 

 2.  "The words that enlighten the soul are more precious than jewels." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Hazrat Inayat Khan</i> 

 3.  "Quarrel not at all. No man resolved to make the most of himself can spare time for personal contention." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Abraham Lincoln</i> 

 4.  "If you look at life one way, there is always cause for alarm." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Elizabeth Bowen</i>
