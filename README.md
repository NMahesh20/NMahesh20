# **_ Hi, you have reached Mahesh's GitHub profile _**
### 🌸 About me ?
My persona falls under INFJ-A, or as per the <a href="https://bigfive-test.com/result/692c68083b5a3f3f12dd9937"> Big-5 metrics</a>. Having a discussion about human psychology, count me in. Apart from that, I am also interested in Science, the Universe, and all other super cool stuff, including Aliens 🤫. Just like the rest, I am also a CS engineer. I try to learn new stuff, and on the way, I implement it in my own style. 
- ☮ My side activities: 🎨♟🎧🌐
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the things that I don't know.
- 😄 Pronouns: He would be fine.
- ⚡ Fun fact: The QWERTY keyboard layout was designed to slow you down.

<!-- BLOG-POST-LIST:START -->
 1.  "Human pain does not let go of its grip at one point in time. Rather, it works its way out of our consciousness over time. There is a season of sadness. A season of anger. A season of tranquility. A season of hope." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Robert Veninga</i> 

 2.  "Live always in the best company when you read." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Sydney Smith</i> 

 3.  "Refuse to be ill. Never tell people you are ill; never own it to yourself. Illness is one of those things which a man should resist on principle." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Edward Bulwer-Lytton</i> 

 4.  "Man seeketh in society comfort, use and protection." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Sir Francis Bacon</i>
