# **_ Hi, you have reached at Mahesh's GitHub profile _**
### 🌸 About me ?
I am INFJ-A, most of the time. Having a discussion about human psychology, count me in, apart from that I am interested in Science, The Universe, and all other super cool stuff including Aliens 🤫. Just like the rest I am also a CS engineer, I try to learn new stuff and on it's way I implement it in my own style. 
- ☮ My side activities: 🎨♟🎧🌐
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the things that I don't know.
- 😄 Pronouns: He would be fine.
- ⚡ Fun fact: The QWERTY keyboard layout was designed to slow you down.

### 🔰 While you are still here have a look at some random quotes
*It changes every day*

<!-- BLOG-POST-LIST:START -->
 1.  "When we make assumptions, we contribute to the complexity rather than the simplicity of a problem, making it more difficult to solve." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Julie A., M.A. Ross and Judy Corcoran</i> 

 2.  "I started thinking about little kids putting a cylindrical peg through a circular hole, and how they do it over and over again for months when they figure it out, and how basketball was basically just a slightly more aerobic version of that same exercise." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by John Green</i> 

 3.  "It is all very well, when the pen flows, but then there are the dark days when imagination deserts one, and it is an effort to put anything down on paper. That little you have achieved stares at you at the end of the day, and you know the next morning you will have to scrape it down and start again." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Elizabeth Aston</i> 

 4.  "This art of resting the mind and the power of dismissing from it all care and worry is probably one of the secrets of energy in our great men." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Captain J. A. Hadfield</i>
