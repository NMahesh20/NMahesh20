# **_ Hi, you have reached at Mahesh's GitHub profile _**
### 🌸 About me ?
I am INFJ-A, most of the time. Having a discussion about human psychology, count me in, apart from that I am interested in Science, The Universe, and all other super cool stuff including Aliens 🤫. Just like the rest I am also a CS engineer, I try to learn new stuff and on it's way I implement it in my own style. 
- ☮ My side activities: 🎨♟🎧🌐
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the things that I don't know.
- 😄 Pronouns: He would be fine.
- ⚡ Fun fact: The QWERTY keyboard layout was designed to slow you down.

*It changes every day*

<!-- BLOG-POST-LIST:START -->
 1.  "Sometimes it seems like God is difficult to find and impossibly far away. We get so caught up in our small daily duties and irritations that they become the only things that we can focus on. What we forget is that God's love and beauty are all around us, every day, if only we would take the time to look up and see them." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Matthias</i> 

 2.  "It's very hard to take yourself too seriously when you look at the world from outer space." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Thomas K. Mattingly II</i> 

 3.  "You've got to do your own growing, no matter how tall your grandfather was." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Irish Proverb</i> 

 4.  "The body is a sacred garment." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Martha Graham</i>
