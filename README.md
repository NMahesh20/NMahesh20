# **_ Hi, you have reached at Mahesh's GitHub profile _**
### 🌸 About me ?
I am INFJ-A, most of the time. Having a discussion about human psychology, count me in, apart from that I am interested in Science, The Universe, and all other super cool stuff including Aliens 🤫. Just like the rest I am also a CS engineer, I try to learn new stuff and on it's way I implement it in my own style. 
- ☮ My side activities: 🎨♟🎧🌐
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the things that I don't know.
- 😄 Pronouns: He would be fine.
- ⚡ Fun fact: The QWERTY keyboard layout was designed to slow you down.

*It changes every day*

<!-- BLOG-POST-LIST:START -->
 1.  "My parents taught me how to listen to everybody before I made up my own mind. When you listen, you learn. You absorb like a sponge-and your life becomes so much better than when you are just trying to be listened to all the time." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Steven Spielberg</i> 

 2.  "One of the things about equality is not just that you be treated equally to a man, but that you treat yourself equally to the way you treat a man." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Marlo Thomas</i> 

 3.  "Do not go where the path may lead, go instead where there is no path and leave a trail." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Ralph Waldo Emerson</i> 

 4.  "Half the money I spend on advertising is wasted; the trouble is I don't know which half." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by John Wanamaker</i>
