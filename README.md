# **_ Hi, you have reached at Mahesh's GitHub profile _**
### 🌸 About me ?
I am INFJ-A, most of the time. Having a discussion about human psychology, count me in, apart from that I am interested in Science, The Universe, and all other super cool stuff including Aliens 🤫. Just like the rest I am also a CS engineer, I try to learn new stuff and on it's way I implement it in my own style. 
- ☮ My side activities: 🎨♟🎧🌐
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the things that I don't know.
- 😄 Pronouns: He would be fine.
- ⚡ Fun fact: The QWERTY keyboard layout was designed to slow you down.

### 🔰 While you are still here have a look at some random quotes
*It changes every day*

<!-- BLOG-POST-LIST:START -->
 1.  "The only real prison is fear, and the only real freedom is freedom from fear." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Aung San Suu Kyi</i> 

 2.  "When Alexander the Great visited Diogenes and asked whether he could do anything for the famed teacher, Diogenes replied: 'Only stand out of my light.' Perhaps some day we shall know how to heighten creativity. Until then, one of the best things we can do for creative men and women is to stand out of their light." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by John W. Gardner</i> 

 3.  "Let me advise thee not to talk of thyself as being old. There is something in Mind Cure, after all, and if thee continually talks of thyself as being old, thee may perhaps bring on some of the infirmities of age. At least I would not risk it if I were thee." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Hannah Whitall Smith</i> 

 4.  "Under all speech that is good for anything there lies a silence that is better. Silence is deep as Eternity; speech is shallow as Time." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Thomas Carlyle</i>
