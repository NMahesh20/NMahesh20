# **_ Hi, you have reached at Mahesh's GitHub profile _**
### 🌸 About me ?
I am INFJ-A, most of the time. Having a discussion about human psychology, count me in, apart from that I am interested in Science, The Universe, and all other super cool stuff including Aliens 🤫. Just like the rest I am also a CS engineer, I try to learn new stuff and on it's way I implement it in my own style. 
- ☮ My side activities: 🎨♟🎧🌐
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the things that I don't know.
- 😄 Pronouns: He would be fine.
- ⚡ Fun fact: The QWERTY keyboard layout was designed to slow you down.

<!-- BLOG-POST-LIST:START -->
 1.  "Life was mostly made up of things you couldn't control, full of surprises, and they weren't always good. Life wasn't what you made it. You were what life made you." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Sara Zarr</i> 

 2.  "If you have the creative urge, it isn't going to go away. But sometimes it takes a while before you accept the fact." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Hugh Macleod</i> 

 3.  "If you don't make mistakes, you're not working on hard enough problems. And that's a big mistake." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Frank Wilczek</i> 

 4.  "The lesson which life repeats and constantly enforces is 'look under foot.' You are always nearer the divine and the true sources of your power than you think." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by John Burroughs</i>
