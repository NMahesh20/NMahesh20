# **_ Hi, you have reached at Mahesh's GitHub profile _**
### 🌸 About me ?
I am INFJ-A, most of the time. Having a discussion about human psychology, count me in, apart from that I am interested in Science, The Universe, and all other super cool stuff including Aliens 🤫. Just like the rest I am also a CS engineer, I try to learn new stuff and on it's way I implement it in my own style. 
- ☮ My side activities: 🎨♟🎧🌐
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the things that I don't know.
- 😄 Pronouns: He would be fine.
- ⚡ Fun fact: The QWERTY keyboard layout was designed to slow you down.

### 🔰 While you are still here have a look at some random quotes
*It changes every day*

<!-- BLOG-POST-LIST:START -->
 1.  "We only know of one duty, and that is to love." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Albert Camus</i> 

 2.  "Returning violence for violence multiplies violence, adding deeper darkness to a night already devoid of stars... Hate cannot drive out hate: only love can do that." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Martin Luther King Jr.</i> 

 3.  "Nobody has things just as he would like them. The thing to do is to make a success with what material I have. It is a sheer waste of time and soulpower to imagine what I would do if things were different. They are not different." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Dr. Frank Crane</i> 

 4.  "I believe love is primarily a choice and only sometimes a feeling. If you want to feel love, choose to love and be patient." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Gordon Atkinson</i>
