# **_ Hi, you have reached at Mahesh's GitHub profile _**
### 🌸 About me ?
I am INFJ-A, most of the time. Having a discussion about human psychology, count me in, apart from that I am interested in Science, The Universe, and all other super cool stuff including Aliens 🤫. Just like the rest I am also a CS engineer, I try to learn new stuff and on it's way I implement it in my own style. 
- ☮ My side activities: 🎨♟🎧🌐
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the things that I don't know.
- 😄 Pronouns: He would be fine.
- ⚡ Fun fact: The QWERTY keyboard layout was designed to slow you down.

### 🔰 While you are still here have a look at some random quotes
*It changes every day*

<!-- BLOG-POST-LIST:START -->
 1.  "When I walk into my kitchen today, I am not alone. Whether we know it or not, none of us is. We bring fathers and mothers and kitchen tables, and every meal we have ever eaten. Food is never just food. It's also a way of getting at something else: who we are, who we have been, and who we want to be." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Molly Wizenberg</i> 

 2.  "Good order is the foundation of all things." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Edmund Burke</i> 

 3.  "If any man wish to write in a clear style, let him be first clear in his thoughts; and if any would write in a noble style, let him first possess a noble soul." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe</i> 

 4.  "A bone to the dog is not charity. Charity is the bone shared with the dog, when you are just as hungry as the dog." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Jack London</i>
