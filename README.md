# **_ Hi, you have reached at Mahesh's GitHub profile _**
### 🌸 About me ?
I am INFJ-A, most of the time. Having a discussion about human psychology, count me in, apart from that I am interested in Science, The Universe, and all other super cool stuff including Aliens 🤫. Just like the rest I am also a CS engineer, I try to learn new stuff and on it's way I implement it in my own style. 
- ☮ My side activities: 🎨♟🎧🌐
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the things that I don't know.
- 😄 Pronouns: He would be fine.
- ⚡ Fun fact: The QWERTY keyboard layout was designed to slow you down.

 1.  "Money's the same, whoever gives it to you. That was the point of money, after all: crisp and clean or wrinkled or disintegrated into quarters - a dollar was always worth a hundred cents." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Scott Westerfeld</i> 

 2.  "The greatest conflicts are not between two people but between one person and himself." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Garth Brooks</i>

 4.  "At the height of laughter, the universe is flung into a kaleidoscope of new possibilities." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Jean Houston</i>
