I am INFJ-A, most of the time. Having a discussion about human psychology, count me in, apart from that I am interested in Science, The Universe, and all other super cool stuff including Aliens 🤫.

### 🔰 While you are still here have a look at some random quotes
*It changes every day*

<!-- BLOG-POST-LIST:START -->
 1.  "Before we get too depressed about the state of our politics, let's remember our history. The great debates of the past, all stirred great passions. They all made somebody angry, and at least once led to a terrible war. What is amazing, is that despite all the conflict, our experiment in democracy has worked better than any form of government on earth." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Barack Obama</i> 

 2.  "The shortest route to getting things done is just do it." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Takayuki Ikkaku, Arisa Hosaka and Toshihiro Kawabata</i> 

 3.  "Affirmations are like prescriptions for certain aspects of yourself you want to change." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Jerry Frankhauser</i> 

 4.  "Hail to you gods, on that day of the great reckoning. Behold me, I have come to you, without sin, without guilt, without evil, without a witness against me, without one whom I have wronged. I am one pure of mouth, pure of hands." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by The Book of the Dead</i>
