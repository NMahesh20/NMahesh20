### 🔰 While you are still here have a look at some random quotes
*It changes every day*

<!-- BLOG-POST-LIST:START -->
 1.  "" <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Jennifer Hudson</i> 

 2.  "If you have something to say, then say it. If not, enjoy the silence while it lasts. The noise will return soon enough. In the meantime, you%uFFFDre better off going out into the big, wide world, having some adventures and refilling your well. Trying to create when you don%uFFFDt feel like it is like making conversation for the sake of making conversation." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Hugh Macleod</i> 

 3.  "I appreciate people who are civil, whether they mean it or not. I think: Be civil. Do not cherish your opinion over my feelings. There's a vanity to candor that isn't really worth it. Be kind." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Richard Greenberg</i> 

 4.  "Chase after truth like hell and you'll free yourself, even though you never touch its coat-tails." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Clarence Darrow</i>
