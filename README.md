### 🌸 About me ?
I am INFJ-A, most of the time. Having a discussion about human psychology, count me in, apart from that I am interested in Science, The Universe, and all other super cool stuff including Aliens 🤫. Just like the rest I am also a CS engineer, I try to learn new stuff and on it's way I implement it in my own style. 
- ☮ My side activities: 🎨♟🎧🌐
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the things that I don't know.
- 😄 Pronouns: He would be fine.
- ⚡ Fun fact: The QWERTY keyboard layout was designed to slow you down.

### 🔰 While you are still here have a look at some random quotes
*It changes every day*

<!-- BLOG-POST-LIST:START -->
 1.  "It is ever so much easier to be good if your clothes are fashionable." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by L. M. Montgomery</i> 

 2.  "You don’t have to get a job that makes others feel comfortable about what they perceive as your success. You don’t have to explain what you plan to do with your life. You don’t have to justify your education by demonstrating its financial rewards. You don’t have to maintain an impeccable credit score. Anyone who expects you to do any of those things has no sense of history or economics or science or the arts./ You have to pay your own electric bill. You have to be kind. You have to give it all you got. You have to find people who love you truly and love them back with the same truth./ But that’s all." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Sugar</i> 

 3.  "Do it now. It is not safe to leave a generous feeling to the cooling influences of the world." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Thomas Guthrie</i> 

 4.  "The highest reward for man's toil is not what he gets for it, but what he becomes by it." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by John Ruskin</i>
