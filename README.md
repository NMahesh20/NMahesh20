I am INFJ-A, most of the time. Having a discussion about human psychology, count me in, apart from that I am interested in Science, The Universe, and all other super cool stuff including Aliens 🤫. Just like the rest I am also a CS engineer, I try to learn new stuff and on it's way I implement it in my own style.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning the things that I don't know.
- 😄 Pronouns: He would be fine.
- ⚡ Fun fact: The QWERTY keyboard layout was designed to slow you down.

*It changes every day*

<!-- BLOG-POST-LIST:START -->
 1.  "The leaders we revere and the businesses that last are generally not the result of a narrow pursuit of popularity or personal advancement, but of devotion to some bigger purpose. That's the hallmark of real success. The other trapping of success might be the by product of this larger mission, but it can't be the central thing." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Barack Obama</i> 

 2.  "I have not yet met with a sorrow that could not be borne, nor with one who's passing did not leave me stronger." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Kathryn L. Nelson</i> 

 3.  "Wonder is what sets us apart from other life forms. No other species wonders about the meaning of existence or the complexity of the universe or themselves." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Herbert W. Boyer</i> 

 4.  "Make hunger thy sauce, as a medicine for health." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Thomas Tusser</i>
