# **_ Hi, you have reached at Mahesh's GitHub profile _**
### 🌸 About me ?
I am INFJ-A, most of the time. Having a discussion about human psychology, count me in, apart from that I am interested in Science, The Universe, and all other super cool stuff including Aliens 🤫. Just like the rest I am also a CS engineer, I try to learn new stuff and on it's way I implement it in my own style. 
- ☮ My side activities: 🎨♟🎧🌐
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the things that I don't know.
- 😄 Pronouns: He would be fine.
- ⚡ Fun fact: The QWERTY keyboard layout was designed to slow you down.

*It changes every day*

<!-- BLOG-POST-LIST:START -->
 1.  "Seasons change, so do cities. People come into your life and people go, but it's comforting to know: the ones you love are always in your heart and if you're very lucky, a plane ride away." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Michael Patrick King</i> 

 2.  "Throughout life, one does not miss any chance to hold onto the things that are really precious, if one is truly wise." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Ed Greenwood</i> 

 3.  "Patterning your life around other's opinions is nothing more than slavery." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Lawana Blackwell</i> 

 4.  "Far better it is to dare mighty things, to win glorious triumphs even though checkered by failure, than to rank with those poor spirits who neither enjoy nor suffer much because they live in the gray twilight that knows neither victory nor defeat." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Theodore Roosevelt</i>
