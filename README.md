### 🌸 About me ?
I am INFJ-A, most of the time. Having a discussion about human psychology, count me in, apart from that I am interested in Science, The Universe, and all other super cool stuff including Aliens 🤫. Just like the rest I am also a CS engineer, I try to learn new stuff and on it's way I implement it in my own style. 
- ☮ My side activities: 🎨♟🎧🌐
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the things that I don't know.
- 😄 Pronouns: He would be fine.
- ⚡ Fun fact: The QWERTY keyboard layout was designed to slow you down.

### 🔰 While you are still here have a look at some random quotes
*It changes every day*

<!-- BLOG-POST-LIST:START -->
 1.  "When I was younger I thought success was something different. I thought, " When I grow up, I want to be famous. I want to be a star. I want to be in movies. When I grow up I want to see the world, drive nice cars. I want to have groupies." But my idea of success is different today. For me, the most important thing in your life is to live your life with integrity and not to give into peer pressure, to try to be something that you're not. To live your life as an honest and compassionate person. To contribute in some way." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Ellen DeGeneres</i> 

 2.  "True originality consists not in a new manner but in a new vision." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Edith Wharton</i> 

 3.  "All that counts in life is intention." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Andrea Bocelli</i> 

 4.  "In a world where there is so much to be done. I felt strongly impressed that there must be something for me to do." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Dorothea Dix</i>
