# **_ Hi, you have reached at Mahesh's GitHub profile _**
### 🌸 About me ?
I am INFJ-A, most of the time. Having a discussion about human psychology, count me in, apart from that I am interested in Science, The Universe, and all other super cool stuff including Aliens 🤫. Just like the rest I am also a CS engineer, I try to learn new stuff and on it's way I implement it in my own style. 
- ☮ My side activities: 🎨♟🎧🌐
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the things that I don't know.
- 😄 Pronouns: He would be fine.
- ⚡ Fun fact: The QWERTY keyboard layout was designed to slow you down.

### 🔰 While you are still here have a look at some random quotes
*It changes every day*

<!-- BLOG-POST-LIST:START -->
 1.  "You will need to find your passion. Don't give up on finding it because then all you're doing is waiting for the Reaper." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Randy Pausch</i> 

 2.  "There is no joy in a life that is all information. There is no 'juice' to that kind of life. No sweetness, no color. Like trading a beautiful golden-ripe orange for a stalk of whithered broccoli." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Tish Grier</i> 

 3.  "That consciousness is everything and that all things begin with a thought. That we are responsible for our own fate, we reap what we sow, we get what we give, we pull in what we put out. I know these things for sure." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Madonna</i> 

 4.  "Leave well - even 'pretty well' - alone: that is what I learn as I get old." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Edward Fitzgerald</i>
