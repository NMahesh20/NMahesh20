### 🌸 About me ?
I am INFJ-A, most of the time. Having a discussion about human psychology, count me in, apart from that I am interested in Science, The Universe, and all other super cool stuff including Aliens 🤫. Just like the rest I am also a CS engineer, I try to learn new stuff and on it's way I implement it in my own style. 
- ☮ My side activities: 🎨♟🎧🌐
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the things that I don't know.
- 😄 Pronouns: He would be fine.
- ⚡ Fun fact: The QWERTY keyboard layout was designed to slow you down.

 2.  "Have you learned the lessons only of those who admired you, and were tender with you, and stood aside for you? Have you not learned great lessons from those who braced themselves against you, and disputed passage with you?" <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Walt Whitman</i> 

 3.  "I didn't see it then, but it turned out that getting fired from Apple was the best thing that could have ever happened to me.

It freed me to enter one of the most creative periods of my life." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Steve Jobs</i> 

 4.  "Life is consciousness." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Emmet Fox</i>
