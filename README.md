### 🌸 About me ?
I am INFJ-A, most of the time. Having a discussion about human psychology, count me in, apart from that I am interested in Science, The Universe, and all other super cool stuff including Aliens 🤫. Just like the rest I am also a CS engineer, I try to learn new stuff and on it's way I implement it in my own style. 
- ☮ My side activities: 🎨♟🎧🌐
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the things that I don't know.
- 😄 Pronouns: He would be fine
- ⚡ Fun fact: Did you know that the center of the Donut is 100% fat free

### 🔰 While you are still here have a look at some random quotes
*It changes every day*

<!-- BLOG-POST-LIST:START -->
 1.  "Better to look weak and be strong than to look strong and be weak." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Laura Moncur</i> 

 2.  "This is pretty much what journals are all about, at least to me. I knew as I wrote them that even though they provided an excellent place for brain (and heart, and psyche) dump, they were mainly a map of me." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Colleen Wainwright</i> 

 3.  "Dreams are postcards from our subconscious, inner self to outer self, right brain trying to cross that moat to the left. Too often they come back unread: "return to sender, addressee unknown." That's a shame because it's a whole other world out there--or in here depending on your point of view." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Dennis Koenig and Jordan Budde</i> 

 4.  "Better to get up late and be wide awake than to get up early and be asleep all day." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Anonymous</i>
