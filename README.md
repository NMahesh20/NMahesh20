# **_ Hi, you have reached at Mahesh's GitHub profile _**
### 🌸 About me ?
I am INFJ-A, most of the time. Having a discussion about human psychology, count me in, apart from that I am interested in Science, The Universe, and all other super cool stuff including Aliens 🤫. Just like the rest I am also a CS engineer, I try to learn new stuff and on it's way I implement it in my own style. 
- ☮ My side activities: 🎨♟🎧🌐
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the things that I don't know.
- 😄 Pronouns: He would be fine.
- ⚡ Fun fact: The QWERTY keyboard layout was designed to slow you down.

<!-- BLOG-POST-LIST:START -->
 1.  "Adversity does teach who your real friends are." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Lois McMaster Bujold</i> 

 2.  "Many people think that if they were only in some other place, or had some other job, they would be happy. Well, that is doubtful. So get as much happiness out of what you are doing as you can and don't put off being happy until some future date." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Dale Carnegie</i> 

 3.  "Everyone is a prisoner of his own experiences. No one can eliminate prejudices - just recognize them." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Edward R. Murrow</i> 

 4.  "Tomatoes and oregano make it Italian; wine and tarragon make it French. Sour cream makes it Russian; lemon and cinnamon make it Greek. Soy sauce makes it Chinese; garlic makes it good." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Alice May Brock</i>
