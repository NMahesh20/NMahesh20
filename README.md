# **_ Hi, you have reached at Mahesh's GitHub profile _**
### 🌸 About me ?
I am INFJ-A, most of the time. Having a discussion about human psychology, count me in, apart from that I am interested in Science, The Universe, and all other super cool stuff including Aliens 🤫. Just like the rest I am also a CS engineer, I try to learn new stuff and on it's way I implement it in my own style. 
- ☮ My side activities: 🎨♟🎧🌐
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the things that I don't know.
- 😄 Pronouns: He would be fine.
- ⚡ Fun fact: The QWERTY keyboard layout was designed to slow you down.

### 🔰 While you are still here have a look at some random quotes
*It changes every day*

<!-- BLOG-POST-LIST:START -->
 1.  "We feel in one world, we think and name in another. Between the two we can set up a system of references, but we cannot fill in the gap." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Marcel Proust</i> 

 2.  "Could we change our attitude, we should not only see life differently, but life itself would come to be different. Life would undergo a change of appearance because we ourselves had undergone a change in attitude." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Katherine Mansfield</i> 

 3.  "The art of mothering is to teach the art of living to children." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Elain Heffner</i> 

 4.  "I'm struck by the insidious, computer-driven tendency to take things out of the domain of muscular activity and put them into the domain of mental activity. The transfer is not paying off. Sure, muscles are unreliable, but they represent several million years of accumulated finesse." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Brian Eno</i>
