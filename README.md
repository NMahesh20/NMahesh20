I am INFJ-A, most of the time. Having a discussion about human psychology, count me in, apart from that I am interested in Science, The Universe, and all other super cool stuff including Aliens 🤫. Just like the rest I am also a CS engineer, I try to learn new stuff and on it's way I implement it in my own style.

- ⚡ Fun fact: The QWERTY keyboard layout was designed to slow you down.

### 🔰 While you are still here have a look at some random quotes
*It changes every day*

<!-- BLOG-POST-LIST:START -->
 1.  "If I've learned one thing in the 14 years I've been a full-time cartoonist, it's that you can not let anyone else define your professionalism. It has to be a personal ethos to which you adhere despite third party influence or acceptance. The old measuring sticks for professionalism are going away and now more than ever it's time for independent creatives to set the bar. Set it high." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Scott R. Kurtz</i> 

 2.  "Your world is made of your memories, and your memories are given to you by your world. The whispering voice of happenstance is always in our ears. 'This is the world. This is the way things are. Look. Pay attention. Remember.'" <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Gordon Atkinson</i> 

 3.  "A person who forgoes the use of his symbolic skills is never really free." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi</i> 

 4.  "Peace is not a relationship of nations. It is a condition of mind brought about by a serenity of soul. Peace is not merely the absence of war. It is also a state of mind. Lasting peace can come only to peaceful people." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Jawaharlal Nehru</i>
