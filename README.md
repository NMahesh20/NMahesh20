# **_ Hi, you have reached Mahesh's GitHub profile _**
### 🌸 About me ?
My persona falls under INFJ-A, or as per the <a href="https://bigfive-test.com/result/692c68083b5a3f3f12dd9937"> Big-5 metrics</a>. Having a discussion about human psychology, count me in. Apart from that, I am also interested in Science, the Universe, and all other super cool stuff, including Aliens 🤫. Just like the rest, I am also a CS engineer. I try to learn new stuff, and on the way, I implement it in my own style.

*It changes every day*

<!-- BLOG-POST-LIST:START -->
 1.  "How could it be? She watched, observed, reflected, and finally determined that this was not a case of fortitude or of resignation only. A submissive spirit might be patient, a strong understanding would supply resolution, but here was something more; here was that elasticity of mind, that disposition to be comforted, that power of turning readily from evil to good, and of finding employment which carried her out of herself, which was from nature alone. It was the choicest gift of Heaven." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Jane Austen</i> 

 2.  "Call it a clan, call it a network, call it a tribe, call it a family. Whatever you call it, whoever you are, you need one." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Jane Howard</i> 

 3.  "Do not wait for the last judgment. It takes place every day." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Albert Camus</i> 

 4.  "Do definite good; first of all to yourself, then to definite persons." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by John Lancaster Spalding</i>
