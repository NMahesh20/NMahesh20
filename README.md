# **_ Hi, you have reached at Mahesh's GitHub profile _**
### 🌸 About me ?
I am INFJ-A, most of the time. Having a discussion about human psychology, count me in, apart from that I am interested in Science, The Universe, and all other super cool stuff including Aliens 🤫. Just like the rest I am also a CS engineer, I try to learn new stuff and on it's way I implement it in my own style. 
- ☮ My side activities: 🎨♟🎧🌐
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the things that I don't know.
- 😄 Pronouns: He would be fine.
- ⚡ Fun fact: The QWERTY keyboard layout was designed to slow you down.

### 🔰 While you are still here have a look at some random quotes
*It changes every day*

<!-- BLOG-POST-LIST:START -->
 1.  "Think of life as a giant, fat cat you're in charge of. Sometimes you can control it, but other times, it's going to do what it wants and you have to roll with it. And sometimes you can do everything - everything you're s'posed to do- and it'll still shred all the things you hold dear... The only thing you can really do with life is rub its belly and prepare for the worst." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Randy K. Milholland</i> 

 2.  "You have got to discover you, what you do, and trust it." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Barbra Streisand</i> 

 3.  "When you want to believe in something, you also have to believe in everything that's necessary for believing in it." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Ugo Betti</i> 

 4.  "Be not the first by whom the new are tried,/ Nor yet the last to lay the old aside." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Alexander Pope</i>
