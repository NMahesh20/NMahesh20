# **_ Hi, you have reached at Mahesh's GitHub profile _**
### 🌸 About me ?
I am INFJ-A, most of the time. Having a discussion about human psychology, count me in, apart from that I am interested in Science, The Universe, and all other super cool stuff including Aliens 🤫. Just like the rest I am also a CS engineer, I try to learn new stuff and on it's way I implement it in my own style. 
- ☮ My side activities: 🎨♟🎧🌐
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the things that I don't know.
- 😄 Pronouns: He would be fine.
- ⚡ Fun fact: The QWERTY keyboard layout was designed to slow you down.

*It changes every day*

<!-- BLOG-POST-LIST:START -->
 1.  "I would visualize things coming to me. It would just make me feel better. Visualization works if you work hard. That's the thing. You can't just visualize and go eat a sandwich." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Jim Carrey</i> 

 2.  "Ignorant men don't know what good they hold in their hands until they've flung it away." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Sophocles</i> 

 3.  "He who every morning plans the transaction of the day and follows out that plan, carries a thread that will guide him through the maze of the most busy life. But where no plan is laid, where the disposal of time is surrendered merely to the chance of incidence, chaos will soon reign." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Victor Hugo</i> 

 4.  "You've got to do your own growing, no matter how tall your grandfather was." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Irish Proverb</i>
