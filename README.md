# **_ Hi, you have reached at Mahesh's GitHub profile _**
### 🌸 About me ?
I am INFJ-A, most of the time. Having a discussion about human psychology, count me in, apart from that I am interested in Science, The Universe, and all other super cool stuff including Aliens 🤫. Just like the rest I am also a CS engineer, I try to learn new stuff and on it's way I implement it in my own style. 
- ☮ My side activities: 🎨♟🎧🌐
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the things that I don't know.
- 😄 Pronouns: He would be fine.
- ⚡ Fun fact: The QWERTY keyboard layout was designed to slow you down.

### 🔰 While you are still here have a look at some random quotes
*It changes every day*

<!-- BLOG-POST-LIST:START -->
 1.  "No one wants to die. Even people who want to go to heaven don't want to die to get there. And yet, death is the destination we all share. No one has ever escaped it, and that is how it should be, because death is very likely the single best invention of life. It's life's change agent. It clears out the old to make way for the new." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Steve Jobs</i> 

 2.  "By the work one knows the workmen." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Jean De La Fontaine</i> 

 3.  "Whenever I hear, 'It can't be done,' I know I'm close to success." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Michael Flatley</i> 

 4.  "Laughter is by definition healthy." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Doris Lessing</i>
