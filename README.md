# **_ Hi, you have reached at Mahesh's GitHub profile _**
### 🌸 About me ?
I am INFJ-A, most of the time. Having a discussion about human psychology, count me in, apart from that I am interested in Science, The Universe, and all other super cool stuff including Aliens 🤫. Just like the rest I am also a CS engineer, I try to learn new stuff and on it's way I implement it in my own style. 
- ☮ My side activities: 🎨♟🎧🌐
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the things that I don't know.
- 😄 Pronouns: He would be fine.
- ⚡ Fun fact: The QWERTY keyboard layout was designed to slow you down.

### 🔰 While you are still here have a look at some random quotes
*It changes every day*

<!-- BLOG-POST-LIST:START -->
 1.  "I'd rather look ridiculous when everybody else does than plain and sensible all by myself." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by L. M. Montgomery</i> 

 2.  "Today is the day in which to express your noblest qualities of mind and heart, to do at least one worthy thing which you have long postponed." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Grenville Kleiser</i> 

 3.  "Eccentricity is not, as dull people would have us believe, a form of madness. It is often a kind of innocent pride, and the man of genius and the aristocrat are frequently regarded as eccentrics because genius and aristocrat are entirely unafraid of and uninfluenced by the opinions and vagaries of the crowd." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Edith Sitwell</i> 

 4.  "" <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Lois McMaster Bujold</i>
