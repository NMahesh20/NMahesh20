# **_ Hi, you have reached Mahesh's GitHub profile _**
### 🌸 About me ?
My persona falls under INFJ-A, or as per the <a href="https://bigfive-test.com/result/692c68083b5a3f3f12dd9937"> Big-5 metrics</a>. Having a discussion about human psychology, count me in. Apart from that, I am also interested in Science, the Universe, and all other super cool stuff, including Aliens 🤫. Just like the rest, I am also a CS engineer. I try to learn new stuff, and on the way, I implement it in my own style. 
- ☮ My side activities: 🎨♟🎧🌐
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the things that I don't know.
- 😄 Pronouns: He would be fine.
- ⚡ Fun fact: The QWERTY keyboard layout was designed to slow you down.

*It changes every day*

<!-- BLOG-POST-LIST:START -->
 1.  "Almost everything: all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure. These things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important. Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Steve Jobs</i> 

 2.  "Part of understanding the creative urge is understanding that it's primal. Wanting to change the world is not a noble calling, it's a primal calling." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Hugh Macleod</i> 

 3.  "Write something to suit yourself and many people will like it; write something to suit everybody and scarcely anyone will care for it." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Jesse Stuart</i> 

 4.  "Never refuse any advance of friendship, for if nine out of ten bring you nothing, one alone may repay you." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Madame de Tencin</i>
