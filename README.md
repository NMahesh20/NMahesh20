# **_ Hi, you have reached at Mahesh's GitHub profile _**
### 🌸 About me ?
I am INFJ-A, most of the time. Having a discussion about human psychology, count me in, apart from that I am interested in Science, The Universe, and all other super cool stuff including Aliens 🤫. Just like the rest I am also a CS engineer, I try to learn new stuff and on it's way I implement it in my own style. 
- ☮ My side activities: 🎨♟🎧🌐
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the things that I don't know.
- 😄 Pronouns: He would be fine.
- ⚡ Fun fact: The QWERTY keyboard layout was designed to slow you down.

 1.  "I merely took the energy it takes to pout and wrote some blues." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Duke Ellington</i> 

 2.  "Avoid destructive thinking. Improper negative thoughts sink people. A ship can sail around the world many, many times, but just let enough water get into the ship and it will sink. Just so with the human mind. Let enough negative thoughts or improper thoughts get into the human mind and the person sinks just like a ship." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Alfred A. Montapert</i> 

 3.  "Trouble is part of your life, and if you don't share it, you don't give the person who loves you a chance to love you enough." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Dinah Shore</i> 

 4.  "The secret of all power is - save your force. If you want high pressure you must choke off waste." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Joseph Farrell</i>
