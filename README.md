### 🌸 About me ?
I am INFJ-A, most of the time. Having a discussion about human psychology, count me in, apart from that I am interested in Science, The Universe, and all other super cool stuff including Aliens 🤫. Just like the rest I am also a CS engineer, I try to learn new stuff and on it's way I implement it in my own style. 
- ☮ My side activities: 🎨♟🎧🌐
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the things that I don't know.
- 😄 Pronouns: He would be fine
- ⚡ Fun fact: Did you know that the center of the Donut is 100% fat free

 1.  "Most people are good. They may not be saints, but they are good." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Jimmy Wales</i> 

 2.  "To believe in God or in a guiding force because someone tells you to is the height of stupidity. We are given senses to receive our information within. With our own eyes we see, and with our own skin we feel. With our intelligence, it is intended that we understand. But each person must puzzle it out for himself or herself." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Sophy Burnham</i> 

 3.  "Sow good services; sweet remembrances will grow them." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Madame de Stael</i> 

 4.  "Use, do not abuse; neither abstinence nor excess ever renders man happy." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Voltaire</i>
