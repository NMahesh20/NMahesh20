# **_ Hi, you have reached at Mahesh's GitHub profile _**
### 🌸 About me ?
I am INFJ-A, most of the time. Having a discussion about human psychology, count me in, apart from that I am interested in Science, The Universe, and all other super cool stuff including Aliens 🤫. Just like the rest I am also a CS engineer, I try to learn new stuff and on it's way I implement it in my own style. 
- ☮ My side activities: 🎨♟🎧🌐
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the things that I don't know.
- 😄 Pronouns: He would be fine.
- ⚡ Fun fact: The QWERTY keyboard layout was designed to slow you down.

*It changes every day*

<!-- BLOG-POST-LIST:START -->
 1.  "Fear sometimes stops you from doing stupid things. But it can also stop you from doing creative or exciting or experimental things. It can cloud your judgment of others, and lead to all kinds of evil. The control and understanding of our personal fears is one of the most important undertakings in our life." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Helen Mirren</i> 

 2.  "The greatest thing in the world is to know how to belong to oneself." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Michel de Montaigne</i> 

 3.  "Never refuse any advance of friendship, for if nine out of ten bring you nothing, one alone may repay you." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Madame de Tencin</i> 

 4.  "Neither a borrower nor a lender be; For loan oft loses both itself and friend; And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry [economy]." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by William Shakespeare</i>
