# **_ Hi, you have reached at Mahesh's GitHub profile _**
### 🌸 About me ?
I am INFJ-A, most of the time. Having a discussion about human psychology, count me in, apart from that I am interested in Science, The Universe, and all other super cool stuff including Aliens 🤫. Just like the rest I am also a CS engineer, I try to learn new stuff and on it's way I implement it in my own style. 
- ☮ My side activities: 🎨♟🎧🌐
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the things that I don't know.
- 😄 Pronouns: He would be fine.
- ⚡ Fun fact: The QWERTY keyboard layout was designed to slow you down.

*It changes every day*

<!-- BLOG-POST-LIST:START -->
 1.  "Self-control is not a problem in the future. It's only a problem NOW when the chocolates is next to us." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Shlomo Bernartzi</i> 

 2.  "The moral virtues, then, are produced in us neither by nature nor against nature. Nature, indeed, prepares in us the ground for their reception, but their complete formation is the product of habit." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Aristotle</i> 

 3.  "Repression is not the way to virtue. When people restrain themselves out of fear, their lives are by necessity diminished. Only through freely chosen discipline can life be enjoyed and still kept within the bounds of reason." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi</i> 

 4.  "The real distinction is between those who adapt their purposes to reality and those who seek to mold reality in the light of their purposes." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Henry Kissinger</i>
