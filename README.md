# **_ Hi, you have reached at Mahesh's GitHub profile _**
### 🌸 About me ?
I am INFJ-A, most of the time. Having a discussion about human psychology, count me in, apart from that I am interested in Science, The Universe, and all other super cool stuff including Aliens 🤫. Just like the rest I am also a CS engineer, I try to learn new stuff and on it's way I implement it in my own style. 
- ☮ My side activities: 🎨♟🎧🌐
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the things that I don't know.
- 😄 Pronouns: He would be fine.
- ⚡ Fun fact: The QWERTY keyboard layout was designed to slow you down.

### 🔰 While you are still here have a look at some random quotes
*It changes every day*

<!-- BLOG-POST-LIST:START -->
 1.  "Perhaps the most important use of money - It saves time. Life is so short, and there's so much to do, one can't afford to waste a minute; and just think how much you waste, for instance, in walking from place to place instead of going by bus and in going by bus instead of by taxi." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by W. Somerset Maugham</i> 

 2.  "The bird of paradise alights only upon the hand that does not grasp." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by John Berry</i> 

 3.  "Ask yourself: Have you been kind today? Make kindness your daily modus operandi and change your world." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Annie Lennox</i> 

 4.  "Silence is one of the great arts of conversation, as allowed by Cicero himself, who says, 'there is not only an art, but an eloquence in it.' A well bred woman may easily and effectually promote the most useful and elegant conversation without speaking a word. The modes of speech are scarcely more variable than the modes of silence." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Tom Blair</i>
