# **_ Hi, you have reached at Mahesh's GitHub profile _**
### 🌸 About me ?
I am INFJ-A, most of the time. Having a discussion about human psychology, count me in, apart from that I am interested in Science, The Universe, and all other super cool stuff including Aliens 🤫. Just like the rest I am also a CS engineer, I try to learn new stuff and on it's way I implement it in my own style. 
- ☮ My side activities: 🎨♟🎧🌐
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the things that I don't know.
- 😄 Pronouns: He would be fine.
- ⚡ Fun fact: The QWERTY keyboard layout was designed to slow you down.

### 🔰 While you are still here have a look at some random quotes
*It changes every day*

<!-- BLOG-POST-LIST:START -->
 1.  "Gaining control over your health and well-being is one of those times in your life that you get to be completely selfish and not feel bad about it. If you want to meet your goals, you have to make it about you. You have to make it work for you and you alone. Anything less is a setup for failure." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Jennifer Hudson</i> 

 2.  "I have learned to love that which is meant to harm me, so that I can stand in the way of those who are less strong. I can take the bullets for those who aren't able to." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Margaret Cho</i> 

 3.  "The way you overcome shyness is to become so wrapped up in something that you forget to be afraid." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Lady Bird Johnson</i> 

 4.  "After all it is those who have a deep and real inner life who are best able to deal with the irritating details of outer life." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Evelyn Underhill</i>
