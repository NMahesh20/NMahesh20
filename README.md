# **_ Hi, you have reached at Mahesh's GitHub profile _**
### 🌸 About me ?
I am INFJ-A, most of the time. Having a discussion about human psychology, count me in, apart from that I am interested in Science, The Universe, and all other super cool stuff including Aliens 🤫. Just like the rest I am also a CS engineer, I try to learn new stuff and on it's way I implement it in my own style. 
- ☮ My side activities: 🎨♟🎧🌐
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the things that I don't know.
- 😄 Pronouns: He would be fine.
- ⚡ Fun fact: The QWERTY keyboard layout was designed to slow you down.

<!-- BLOG-POST-LIST:START -->
 1.  "That was the worst part about having cancer, sometimes: The physical evidence of disease separates you from other people." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by John Green</i> 

 2.  "A leader takes people where they want to go. A great leader takes people where they don't necessarily want to go but where they ought to be." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Rosalynn Carter</i> 

 3.  "Learn to see in another's calamity the ills which you should avoid." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Publilius Syrus</i> 

 4.  "Photographers do this for a living, every single day -- they point their lenses toward every single corner of our world and somehow make the mundane mesmerizing through their artistic eye. It's all a matter of being aware of your surroundings and realizing that there are some really amazing and interesting things to look at, even if it may just be something so simple as a wall being covered up by paint." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Ward Jenkins</i>
