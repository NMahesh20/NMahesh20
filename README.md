# **_ Hi, you have reached at Mahesh's GitHub profile _**
### 🌸 About me ?
I am INFJ-A, most of the time. Having a discussion about human psychology, count me in, apart from that I am interested in Science, The Universe, and all other super cool stuff including Aliens 🤫. Just like the rest I am also a CS engineer, I try to learn new stuff and on it's way I implement it in my own style. 
- ☮ My side activities: 🎨♟🎧🌐
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the things that I don't know.
- 😄 Pronouns: He would be fine.
- ⚡ Fun fact: The QWERTY keyboard layout was designed to slow you down.

### 🔰 While you are still here have a look at some random quotes
*It changes every day*

<!-- BLOG-POST-LIST:START -->
 1.  "I was thinking about the universe wanting to be noticed, and how I had to notice it as best I could. I felt that I owed a debt to the universe that only my attention could repay, and also that I owed a debt to everybody who didn’t get to be a person anymore and everyone who hadn’t gotten to be a person yet." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by John Green</i> 

 2.  "Trees were so rare in that country, and they had to make such a hard fight to grow, that we used to feel anxious about them, and visit them as if they were persons. It must have been the scarcity of detail in that tawny landscape that made detail so precious." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Willa Cather</i> 

 3.  "A duty dodged is like a debt unpaid; it is only deferred, and we must come back and settle the account at last." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Joseph F. Newton</i> 

 4.  "Our remedies oft in ourselves do lie." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by William Shakespeare</i>
