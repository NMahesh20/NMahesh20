# **_ Hi, you have reached Mahesh's GitHub profile _**
### 🌸 About me ?
My persona falls under INFJ-A, or as per the <a href="https://bigfive-test.com/result/692c68083b5a3f3f12dd9937"> Big-5 metrics</a>. Having a discussion about human psychology, count me in. Apart from that, I am also interested in Science, the Universe, and all other super cool stuff, including Aliens 🤫. Just like the rest, I am also a CS engineer. I try to learn new stuff, and on the way, I implement it in my own style. 
- ☮ My side activities: 🎨♟🎧🌐
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the things that I don't know.
- 😄 Pronouns: He would be fine.
- ⚡ Fun fact: The QWERTY keyboard layout was designed to slow you down.

### 🔰 While you are still here, have a look at some random quotes
*It changes every day*

<!-- BLOG-POST-LIST:START -->
 1.  "Letting your customers set your standards is a dangerous game, because the race to the bottom is pretty easy to win. Setting your own standards--and living up to them--is a better way to profit. Not to mention a better way to make your day worth all the effort you put into it." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Seth Godin</i> 

 2.  "If we can connect in some tiny way with a human that doesn't agree with us, then maybe we won't blow up the planet." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Nancy White</i> 

 3.  "Nobody sees a flower - really - it is so small it takes time - we haven't time - and to see takes time, like to have a friend takes time." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Georgia O'Keeffe</i> 

 4.  "Health is not valued till sickness comes." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Dr. Thomas Fuller</i>
