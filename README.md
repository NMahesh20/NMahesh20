# **_ Hi, you have reached at Mahesh's GitHub profile _**
### 🌸 About me ?
I am INFJ-A, most of the time. Having a discussion about human psychology, count me in, apart from that I am interested in Science, The Universe, and all other super cool stuff including Aliens 🤫. Just like the rest I am also a CS engineer, I try to learn new stuff and on it's way I implement it in my own style. 
- ☮ My side activities: 🎨♟🎧🌐
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the things that I don't know.
- 😄 Pronouns: He would be fine.
- ⚡ Fun fact: The QWERTY keyboard layout was designed to slow you down.

<!-- BLOG-POST-LIST:START -->
 1.  "The best way to learn to be an honest, responsible adult is to live with adults who act honestly and responsibly." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Claudia Jewett Jarrett</i> 

 2.  "The man who backbites an absent friend, nay, who does not stand up for him when another blames him, the man who angles for bursts of laughter and for the repute of a wit, who can invent what he never saw, who cannot keep a secret - that man is black at heart: mark and avoid him." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Cicero</i> 

 3.  "It is a fine thing to establish one's own religion in one's heart, not to be dependent on tradition and second-hand ideals. Life will seem to you, later, not a lesser, but a greater thing." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by D. H. Lawrence</i> 

 4.  "At a dinner party one should eat wisely but not too well, and talk well but not too wisely." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by W. Somerset Maugham</i>
