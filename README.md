# **_ Hi, you have reached at Mahesh's GitHub profile _**
### 🌸 About me ?
I am INFJ-A, most of the time. Having a discussion about human psychology, count me in, apart from that I am interested in Science, The Universe, and all other super cool stuff including Aliens 🤫. Just like the rest I am also a CS engineer, I try to learn new stuff and on it's way I implement it in my own style. 
- ☮ My side activities: 🎨♟🎧🌐
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the things that I don't know.
- 😄 Pronouns: He would be fine.
- ⚡ Fun fact: The QWERTY keyboard layout was designed to slow you down.

### 🔰 While you are still here have a look at some random quotes
*It changes every day*

<!-- BLOG-POST-LIST:START -->
 1.  "Keep playing games. Make time to play games with your friends and family, because it's surprisingly heartbreaking to wipe a thin layer of dust off a game you love, before you put it back on the shelf because the real world is calling you." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Wil Wheaton</i> 

 2.  "Your mailbox is your window to your heart! Make sure you leave that window open!" <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Takayuki Ikkaku, Arisa Hosaka and Toshihiro Kawabata</i> 

 3.  "I am so beautiful, sometimes people weep when they see me. And it has nothing to do with what I look like really, it is just that I gave myself the power to say that I am beautiful, and if I could do that, maybe there is hope for them too. And the great divide between the beautiful and the ugly will cease to be. Because we are all what we choose." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Margaret Cho</i> 

 4.  "The best things carried to excess are wrong." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Charles Churchill</i>
