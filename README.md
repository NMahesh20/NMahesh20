I am INFJ-A, most of the time. Having a discussion about human psychology, count me in, apart from that I am interested in Science, The Universe, and all other super cool stuff including Aliens 🤫. Just like the rest I am also a CS engineer, I try to learn new stuff and on it's way I implement it in my own style.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning the things that I don't know.

- ⚡ Fun fact: The QWERTY keyboard layout was designed to slow you down.
