 1.  "" <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by John Green</i> 

 2.  "The happiest excitement in life is to be convinced that one is fighting for all one is worth on behalf of some clearly seen and deeply felt good." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Ruth Benedict</i> 

 3.  "As we look deeply within, we understand our perfect balance. There is no fear of the cycle of birth, life and death. For when you stand in the present moment, you are timeless." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Rodney Yee</i> 

 4.  "Follow the path of the unsafe, independent thinker. Expose your ideas to the dangers of controversy. Speak your mind and fear less the label of 'crackpot' than the stigma of conformity.
