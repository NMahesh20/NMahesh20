# **_ Hi, you have reached at Mahesh's GitHub profile _**
### 🌸 About me ?
I am INFJ-A, most of the time. Having a discussion about human psychology, count me in, apart from that I am interested in Science, The Universe, and all other super cool stuff including Aliens 🤫. Just like the rest I am also a CS engineer, I try to learn new stuff and on it's way I implement it in my own style. 
- ☮ My side activities: 🎨♟🎧🌐
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the things that I don't know.
- 😄 Pronouns: He would be fine.
- ⚡ Fun fact: The QWERTY keyboard layout was designed to slow you down.

 1.  "The more passions and desires one has, the more ways one has of being happy." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Charlotte-Catherine</i> 

 2.  "Security is a kind of death." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Tennessee Williams</i> 

 3.  "Living apart and at peace with myself, I came to realize more vividly the meaning of the doctrine of acceptance. To refrain from giving advice, to refrain from meddling in the affairs of others, to refrain, even though the motives be the highest, from tampering with another's way of life - so simple, yet so difficult for an active spirit. Hands off!" <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Henry Miller</i> 

 4.  "The time to stop talking is when the other person nods his head affirmatively but says nothing." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Henry S. Haskins</i>
