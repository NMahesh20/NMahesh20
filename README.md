# **_ Hi, you have reached at Mahesh's GitHub profile _**
### 🌸 About me ?
I am INFJ-A, most of the time. Having a discussion about human psychology, count me in, apart from that I am interested in Science, The Universe, and all other super cool stuff including Aliens 🤫. Just like the rest I am also a CS engineer, I try to learn new stuff and on it's way I implement it in my own style. 
- ☮ My side activities: 🎨♟🎧🌐
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the things that I don't know.
- 😄 Pronouns: He would be fine.
- ⚡ Fun fact: The QWERTY keyboard layout was designed to slow you down.

### 🔰 While you are still here have a look at some random quotes
*It changes every day*

<!-- BLOG-POST-LIST:START -->
 1.  "The most difficult part of writing a book is not devising a plot which will captivate the reader. It's not developing characters the reader will have strong feelings for or against. It is not finding a setting which will take the reader to a place he or she as never been. It is not the research, whether in fiction or non-fiction. The most difficult task facing a writer is to find the voice in which to tell the story." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Randy Pausch</i> 

 2.  "Besides the noble art of getting things done, there is a nobler art of leaving things undone. The wisdom of life consists in the elimination of nonessentials." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Lin Yutang</i> 

 3.  "Life ought to be a struggle of desire toward adventures whose nobility will fertilize the soul." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Rebecca West</i> 

 4.  "An honor is not diminished for being shared." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Lois McMaster Bujold</i>
