# **_ Hi, you have reached at Mahesh's GitHub profile _**
### 🌸 About me ?
I am INFJ-A, most of the time. Having a discussion about human psychology, count me in, apart from that I am interested in Science, The Universe, and all other super cool stuff including Aliens 🤫. Just like the rest I am also a CS engineer, I try to learn new stuff and on it's way I implement it in my own style. 
- ☮ My side activities: 🎨♟🎧🌐
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the things that I don't know.
- 😄 Pronouns: He would be fine.
- ⚡ Fun fact: The QWERTY keyboard layout was designed to slow you down.

<!-- BLOG-POST-LIST:START -->
 1.  "A true friend knows your weaknesses but shows you your strengths; feels your fears but fortifies your faith; sees your anxieties but frees your spirit; recognizes your disabilities but emphasizes your possibilities." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by William Arthur Ward</i> 

 2.  "It is not easy to find happiness in ourselves, and it is not possible to find it elsewhere." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Agnes Repplier</i> 

 3.  "The excellence of a gift lies in its appropriateness rather than in its value." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Charles Dudley Warner</i> 

 4.  "Life is either a daring adventure or nothing. Security does not exist in nature, nor do the children of men as a whole experience it. Avoiding danger is no safer in the long run than exposure." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Helen Keller</i>
