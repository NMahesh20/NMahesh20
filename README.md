# **_ Hi, you have reached at Mahesh's GitHub profile _**
### 🌸 About me ?
I am INFJ-A, most of the time. Having a discussion about human psychology, count me in, apart from that I am interested in Science, The Universe, and all other super cool stuff including Aliens 🤫. Just like the rest I am also a CS engineer, I try to learn new stuff and on it's way I implement it in my own style. 
- ☮ My side activities: 🎨♟🎧🌐
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the things that I don't know.
- 😄 Pronouns: He would be fine.
- ⚡ Fun fact: The QWERTY keyboard layout was designed to slow you down.

### 🔰 While you are still here have a look at some random quotes
*It changes every day*

<!-- BLOG-POST-LIST:START -->
 1.  "In order to truly give to others, you have to give to yourself first." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Ali Vincent</i> 

 2.  "If you have made mistakes, even serious ones, there is always another chance for you. What we call failure is not the falling down but the staying down." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Mary Pickford</i> 

 3.  "Patience serves as a protection against wrongs as clothes do against cold. For if you put on more clothes as the cold increases, it will have no power to hurt you. So in like manner you must grow in patience when you meet with great wrongs, and they will then be powerless to vex your mind." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Leonardo da Vinci</i> 

 4.  "Decide what you want, decide what you are willing to exchange for it. Establish your priorities and go to work." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by H. L. Hunt</i>
