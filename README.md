### 🌸 About me ?
I am INFJ-A, most of the time. Having a discussion about human psychology, count me in, apart from that I am interested in Science, The Universe, and all other super cool stuff including Aliens 🤫. Just like the rest I am also a CS engineer, I try to learn new stuff and on it's way I implement it in my own style. 
- ☮ My side activities: 🎨♟🎧🌐
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the things that I don't know.
- 😄 Pronouns: He would be fine
- ⚡ Fun fact: Did you know that the center of the Donut is 100% fat free

*It changes every day*

<!-- BLOG-POST-LIST:START -->
 1.  "I go to movies expecting to have a whole experience. If I want a movie that doesn't end, I'll go to a French movie. A movie has to be complete within itself; it can't just build off the first one or play variations." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Joss Whedon</i> 

 2.  "If a man insisted always on being serious, and never allowed himself a bit of fun and relaxation, he would go mad or become unstable without knowing it." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Herodotus</i> 

 3.  "Ambition often puts men upon doing the meanest offices; so climbing is performed in the same posture with creeping." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Jonathan Swift</i> 

 4.  "Nothing ever goes away." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Barry Commoner</i>
