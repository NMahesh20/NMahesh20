# **_ Hi, you have reached at Mahesh's GitHub profile _**
### 🌸 About me ?
I am INFJ-A, most of the time. Having a discussion about human psychology, count me in, apart from that I am interested in Science, The Universe, and all other super cool stuff including Aliens 🤫. Just like the rest I am also a CS engineer, I try to learn new stuff and on it's way I implement it in my own style. 
- ☮ My side activities: 🎨♟🎧🌐
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the things that I don't know.
- 😄 Pronouns: He would be fine.
- ⚡ Fun fact: The QWERTY keyboard layout was designed to slow you down.

### 🔰 While you are still here have a look at some random quotes
*It changes every day*

<!-- BLOG-POST-LIST:START -->
 1.  "And since, in our passage through this world, painful circumstances occur more frequently than pleasing ones, and since our sense of evil is, I fear, more acute than our sense of good, we become the victims of our feelings, unless we can in some degree command them." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Ann Radcliffe</i> 

 2.  "Every moment of one's existence one is growing into more or retreating into less." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Norman Mailer</i> 

 3.  "In peace there's nothing so becomes a man/
As modest stillness and humility;/
But when the blast of war blows in our ears,/
Then imitate the action of the tiger:/
Stiffen the sinews, summon up the blood." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by William Shakespeare</i> 

 4.  "Let not thy will roar, when thy power can but whisper." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Dr. Thomas Fuller</i>
