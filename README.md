### 🔰 While you are still here have a look at some random quotes
*It changes every day*

<!-- BLOG-POST-LIST:START -->
 1.  "If I've learned one thing in the 14 years I've been a full-time cartoonist, it's that you can not let anyone else define your professionalism. It has to be a personal ethos to which you adhere despite third party influence or acceptance. The old measuring sticks for professionalism are going away and now more than ever it's time for independent creatives to set the bar. Set it high." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Scott R. Kurtz</i> 

 2.  "Say little, and love much; give all; judge no man; aspire to all that is pure and good." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by White Eagle</i> 

 3.  "The purpose of life is to live it, to taste experience to the utmost, to reach out eagerly and without fear for newer and richer experience." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Eleanor Roosevelt</i> 

 4.  "Don't make use of another's mouth unless it has been lent to you." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Belgian Proverb</i>
