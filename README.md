# **_ Hi, you have reached at Mahesh's GitHub profile _**
### 🌸 About me ?
I am INFJ-A, most of the time. Having a discussion about human psychology, count me in, apart from that I am interested in Science, The Universe, and all other super cool stuff including Aliens 🤫. Just like the rest I am also a CS engineer, I try to learn new stuff and on it's way I implement it in my own style. 
- ☮ My side activities: 🎨♟🎧🌐
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the things that I don't know.
- 😄 Pronouns: He would be fine.
- ⚡ Fun fact: The QWERTY keyboard layout was designed to slow you down.

 1.  "To think about your life is to create it. You have to take ownership of where you are right now and know where you want to go before you can get there. Keep collecting evidence for your success. You can believe it, and you can be it." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Ali Vincent</i> 

 2.  "We all self-conscious. I'm just the first to admit it." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Kanye West</i> 

 3.  "Marvelous Truth, confront us at every turn, in every guise." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Denise Levertov</i> 

 4.  "I have enjoyed greatly the second blooming that comes when you finish the life of the emotions and of personal relations; and suddenly find - at the age of fifty, say - that a whole new life has opened before you, filled with things you can think about, study, or read about...It is as if a fresh sap of ideas and thoughts was rising in you." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Agatha Christie</i>
