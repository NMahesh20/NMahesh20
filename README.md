### ðŸŒ¸ About me ?
I am INFJ-A, most of the time. Having a discussion about human psychology, count me in, apart from that I am interested in Science, The Universe, and all other super cool stuff including UFO/UAPs ðŸ¤«. Just like the rest I am also a CS engineer, I try to learn new stuff and on it's way I implement it in my own style. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning the things that I don't know.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He would be fine
- âš¡ Fun fact: Did you know that the center of the Donut is 100% fat free
