# **_ Hi, you have reached at Mahesh's GitHub profile _**
### 🌸 About me ?
I am INFJ-A, most of the time. Having a discussion about human psychology, count me in, apart from that I am interested in Science, The Universe, and all other super cool stuff including Aliens 🤫. Just like the rest I am also a CS engineer, I try to learn new stuff and on it's way I implement it in my own style. 
- ☮ My side activities: 🎨♟🎧🌐
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the things that I don't know.
- 😄 Pronouns: He would be fine.
- ⚡ Fun fact: The QWERTY keyboard layout was designed to slow you down.

### 🔰 While you are still here have a look at some random quotes
*It changes every day*

<!-- BLOG-POST-LIST:START -->
 1.  "How do you define God? Like this. A God I could understand, at least potentially, was infinitely more interesting and relevant than one that defied comprehension." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Robert J. Sawyer</i> 

 2.  "Americans are overreachers; overreaching is the most admirable of the many American excesses." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by George F. Will</i> 

 3.  "Don't flatter yourself that friendship authorizes you to say disagreeable things to your intimates. The nearer you come into relation with a person, the more necessary do tact and courtesy become. Except in cases of necessity, which are rare, leave your friend to learn unpleasant things from his enemies; they are ready enough to tell them." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Oliver Wendell Holmes</i> 

 4.  "Do not anticipate trouble, or worry about what may never happen. Keep in the sunlight." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Benjamin Franklin</i>
