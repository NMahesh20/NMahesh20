# **_ Hi, you have reached at Mahesh's GitHub profile _**
### 🌸 About me ?
I am INFJ-A, most of the time. Having a discussion about human psychology, count me in, apart from that I am interested in Science, The Universe, and all other super cool stuff including Aliens 🤫. Just like the rest I am also a CS engineer, I try to learn new stuff and on it's way I implement it in my own style. 
- ☮ My side activities: 🎨♟🎧🌐
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the things that I don't know.
- 😄 Pronouns: He would be fine.
- ⚡ Fun fact: The QWERTY keyboard layout was designed to slow you down.

### 🔰 While you are still here have a look at some random quotes
*It changes every day*

<!-- BLOG-POST-LIST:START -->
 1.  "We made a solemn vow not to take any job outside of show business. We borrowed money from parents and friends, rather than take that lethal job waiting tables. This forced us to take any job offered to us. Anything. We once did a show in the middle of the Benjamin Franklin Parkway in Philadelphia as part of a fashion show on a hot July night while all around our stage, a race-riot was fully underway. That's how serious we were about our vow." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Raymond Joseph Teller</i> 

 2.  "What helps luck is a habit of watching for opportunities, of having a patient, but restless mind, of sacrificing one's ease or vanity, of uniting a love of detail to foresight, and of passing through hard times bravely and cheerfully." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Charles Victor Cherbuliez</i> 

 3.  "A human being must have occupation if he or she is not to become a nuisance to the world." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Dorothy L. Sayers</i> 

 4.  "Retirement at sixty-five is ridiculous. When I was sixty-five I still had pimples." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by George Burns</i>
