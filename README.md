# **_ Hi, you have reached at Mahesh's GitHub profile _**
### 🌸 About me ?
I am INFJ-A, most of the time. Having a discussion about human psychology, count me in, apart from that I am interested in Science, The Universe, and all other super cool stuff including Aliens 🤫. Just like the rest I am also a CS engineer, I try to learn new stuff and on it's way I implement it in my own style. 
- ☮ My side activities: 🎨♟🎧🌐
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the things that I don't know.
- 😄 Pronouns: He would be fine.
- ⚡ Fun fact: The QWERTY keyboard layout was designed to slow you down.

 1.  "The meek shall inherit the earth? Well... I don't think so. If by meek you mean friendly and introverted, okay maybe, but if by meek you mean unwilling to take a chance, then never. If I was a betting man and I had to wager on who I thought would inherit the earth, my money would be on the curious." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Jim Coudal</i> 

 2.  "In the absences of a decent time machine, fiction remains the most sturdy vehicle for visiting other eras." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Tom Nolan</i> 

 3.  "I'm a great believer in luck, and I find the harder I work the more I have of it." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Thomas Jefferson</i> 

 4.  "Depend not on another, but lean instead on thyself...True happiness is born of self-reliance." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by The laws of Manu</i>
