# **_ Hi, you have reached Mahesh's GitHub profile _**
### 🌸 About me ?
My persona falls under INFJ-A, or as per the <a href="https://bigfive-test.com/result/692c68083b5a3f3f12dd9937"> Big-5 metrics</a>. Having a discussion about human psychology, count me in. Apart from that, I am also interested in Science, the Universe, and all other super cool stuff, including Aliens 🤫. Just like the rest, I am also a CS engineer. I try to learn new stuff, and on the way, I implement it in my own style. 
- ☮ My side activities: 🎨♟🎧🌐
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the things that I don't know.
- 😄 Pronouns: He would be fine.
- ⚡ Fun fact: The QWERTY keyboard layout was designed to slow you down.

### 🔰 While you are still here, have a look at some random quotes
*It changes every day*

<!-- BLOG-POST-LIST:START -->
 1.  "'Where and how can I make this meal better for me?' I asked myself that question before every meal—especially in the beginning." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Jennifer Hudson</i> 

 2.  "Parents are never as bad as kids think they are." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Matt Witten</i> 

 3.  "Adulthood isn't an award they'll give you for being a good child. You can waste... years, trying to get someone to give that respect to you, as though it were a sort of promotion or raise in pay. If only you do enough, if only you are good enough. No. You have to just... take it. Give it to yourself, I suppose. Say, I'm sorry you feel like that and walk away. But that's hard." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Lois McMaster Bujold</i> 

 4.  "When defeat is inevitable, it is wisest to yield." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Quintilian</i>
