# **_ Hi, you have reached at Mahesh's GitHub profile _**
### 🌸 About me ?
I am INFJ-A, most of the time. Having a discussion about human psychology, count me in, apart from that I am interested in Science, The Universe, and all other super cool stuff including Aliens 🤫. Just like the rest I am also a CS engineer, I try to learn new stuff and on it's way I implement it in my own style. 
- ☮ My side activities: 🎨♟🎧🌐
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the things that I don't know.
- 😄 Pronouns: He would be fine.
- ⚡ Fun fact: The QWERTY keyboard layout was designed to slow you down.

<!-- BLOG-POST-LIST:START -->
 1.  "However beautiful the strategy, you should occasionally look at the results." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Sir Winston Churchill</i> 

 2.  "He who endeavors to serve, to benefit, and improve the world, is like a swimmer, who struggles against a rapid current, in a river lashed into angry waves by the winds. Often they roar over his head, often they beat him back and baffle him. Most men yield to the stress of the current... Only here and there the stout, strong heart and vigorous arms struggle on toward ultimate success." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Albert Pike</i> 

 3.  "Your first appearance, he said to me, is the gauge by which you will be measured; try to manage that you may go beyond yourself in after times, but beware of ever doing less." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Jean Jacques Rousseau</i> 

 4.  "[Common sense] is the best sense I know of." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Lord Chesterfield</i>
