# **_ Hi, you have reached at Mahesh's GitHub profile _**
### 🌸 About me ?
I am INFJ-A, most of the time. Having a discussion about human psychology, count me in, apart from that I am interested in Science, The Universe, and all other super cool stuff including Aliens 🤫. Just like the rest I am also a CS engineer, I try to learn new stuff and on it's way I implement it in my own style. 
- ☮ My side activities: 🎨♟🎧🌐
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the things that I don't know.
- 😄 Pronouns: He would be fine.
- ⚡ Fun fact: The QWERTY keyboard layout was designed to slow you down.

 1.  "Any ordinary favor we do for someone or any compassionate reaching out may seem to be going nowhere at first, but may be planting a seed we can't see right now.

 2.  "There shall be eternal summer in the grateful heart." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Celia Thaxter</i> 

 3.  "Live neither in the past nor in the future, but let each day's work absorb your entire energies, and satisfy your widest ambition." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Sir William Osler</i> 

 4.  "The secret of joy in work is contained in one word - excellence. To know how to do something well is to enjoy it." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Pearl Buck</i>
