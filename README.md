### 🔰 While you are still here have a look at some random quotes
*It changes every day*

<!-- BLOG-POST-LIST:START -->
 1.  "If I've learned one thing in the 14 years I've been a full-time cartoonist, it's that you can not let anyone else define your professionalism. It has to be a personal ethos to which you adhere despite third party influence or acceptance. The old measuring sticks for professionalism are going away and now more than ever it's time for independent creatives to set the bar. Set it high." 
       *-by Scott R. Kurtz* 

 2.  "The true mystery of the world is the visible, not the invisible." 
       *-by Oscar Wilde* 

 3.  "What we have to do is to be forever curiously testing new opinions and courting new impressions." 
       *-by Walter Pater* 

 4.  "It is pretty hard to tell what does bring happiness; poverty and wealth have both failed." 
       *-by Kin Hubbard*
