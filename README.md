# **_ Hi, you have reached Mahesh's GitHub profile _**
### 🌸 About me ?
My persona falls under INFJ-A, or as per the <a href="https://bigfive-test.com/result/692c68083b5a3f3f12dd9937"> Big-5 metrics</a>. Having a discussion about human psychology, count me in. Apart from that, I am also interested in Science, the Universe, and all other super cool stuff, including Aliens 🤫. Just like the rest, I am also a CS engineer. I try to learn new stuff, and on the way, I implement it in my own style. 
- ☮ My side activities: 🎨♟🎧🌐
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the things that I don't know.
- 😄 Pronouns: He would be fine.
- ⚡ Fun fact: The QWERTY keyboard layout was designed to slow you down.

### 🔰 While you are still here, have a look at some random quotes
*It changes every day*

<!-- BLOG-POST-LIST:START -->
 1.  "We must always change, renew, rejuvenate ourselves; otherwise we harden." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe</i> 

 2.  "The only gift is a portion of thyself." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Ralph Waldo Emerson</i> 

 3.  "He who endeavors to serve, to benefit, and improve the world, is like a swimmer, who struggles against a rapid current, in a river lashed into angry waves by the winds. Often they roar over his head, often they beat him back and baffle him. Most men yield to the stress of the current... Only here and there the stout, strong heart and vigorous arms struggle on toward ultimate success." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Albert Pike</i> 

 4.  "The golden moments in the stream of life rush past us and we see nothing but sand; the angels come to visit us, and we only know them when they are gone." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by George Eliot</i>
