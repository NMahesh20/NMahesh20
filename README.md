# **_ Hi, you have reached at Mahesh's GitHub profile _**
### 🌸 About me ?
I am INFJ-A, most of the time. Having a discussion about human psychology, count me in, apart from that I am interested in Science, The Universe, and all other super cool stuff including Aliens 🤫. Just like the rest I am also a CS engineer, I try to learn new stuff and on it's way I implement it in my own style. 
- ☮ My side activities: 🎨♟🎧🌐
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the things that I don't know.
- 😄 Pronouns: He would be fine.
- ⚡ Fun fact: The QWERTY keyboard layout was designed to slow you down.

### 🔰 While you are still here have a look at some random quotes
*It changes every day*

<!-- BLOG-POST-LIST:START -->
 1.  "One of the joys we have in being human is in exercising our freedom to choose and to take each case as it comes to us. We are not robots who are forced into behaviors by their programming. We see things; we think about things; and we choose our course of action or beliefs appropriately. And as long as that remains true of us, we will live every day of our lives on one slippery slope or another. There is no reason to fear this." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Gordon Atkinson</i> 

 2.  "When you leave college, there are thousands of people out there with the same degree you have; when you get a job, there will be thousands of people doing what you want to do for a living. But you are the only person alive who has sole custody of your life." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Anna Quindlen</i> 

 3.  "If my hands are fully occupied in holding on to something, I can neither give nor receive." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Dorothee Solle</i> 

 4.  "Riches may enable us to confer favours, but to confer them with propriety and grace requires a something that riches cannot give." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Charles Caleb Colton</i>
