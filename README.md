# **_ Hi, you have reached at Mahesh's GitHub profile _**
### 🌸 About me ?
I am INFJ-A, most of the time. Having a discussion about human psychology, count me in, apart from that I am interested in Science, The Universe, and all other super cool stuff including Aliens 🤫. Just like the rest I am also a CS engineer, I try to learn new stuff and on it's way I implement it in my own style. 
- ☮ My side activities: 🎨♟🎧🌐
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the things that I don't know.
- 😄 Pronouns: He would be fine.
- ⚡ Fun fact: The QWERTY keyboard layout was designed to slow you down.

### 🔰 While you are still here have a look at some random quotes
*It changes every day*

<!-- BLOG-POST-LIST:START -->
 1.  "Everything we do really is just a little marker on the long road to death. And sometimes that's overwhelmingly depressing to me, and sometimes it makes me feel kinship and forgiveness. We've all got the same ending to the story. The way we make that story more elaborate, I got to respect." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Joss Whedon</i> 

 2.  "When you close your doors, and make darkness within, remember never to say that you are alone, for you are not alone; nay, God is within, and your genius is within. And what need have they of light to see what you are doing?" <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Epictetus</i> 

 3.  "Laziness is nothing more than the habit of resting before you get tired." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Jules Renard</i> 

 4.  "What's money? A man is a success if he gets up in the morning and goes to bed at night and in between does what he wants to do." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Bob Dylan</i>
