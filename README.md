### 🌸 About me ?
I am INFJ-A, most of the time. Having a discussion about human psychology, count me in, apart from that I am interested in Science, The Universe, and all other super cool stuff including Aliens 🤫. Just like the rest I am also a CS engineer, I try to learn new stuff and on it's way I implement it in my own style.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning the things that I don't know.
- 😄 Pronouns: He would be fine.
- ⚡ Fun fact: The QWERTY keyboard layout was designed to slow you down.

### 🔰 While you are still here have a look at some random quotes
*It changes every day*

<!-- BLOG-POST-LIST:START -->
 1.  "I always wanted a happy ending... Now I've learned, the hard way, that some poems don't rhyme, and some stories don't have a clear beginning, middle and end. Life is about not knowing, having to change, taking the moment and making the best of it without knowing what's going to happen next. Delicious ambiguity." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Gilda Radner</i> 

 2.  "Chance is always powerful. Let your hook be always cast; in the pool where you least expect it, there will be a fish." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Ovid</i> 

 3.  "Never part without loving words to think of during your absence. It may be that you will not meet again in life." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Jean Paul Richter</i> 

 4.  "Be civil to all; sociable to many; familiar with few; friend to one; enemy to none." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Benjamin Franklin</i>
