# **_ Hi, you have reached at Mahesh's GitHub profile _**
### 🌸 About me ?
I am INFJ-A, most of the time. Having a discussion about human psychology, count me in, apart from that I am interested in Science, The Universe, and all other super cool stuff including Aliens 🤫. Just like the rest I am also a CS engineer, I try to learn new stuff and on it's way I implement it in my own style. 
- ☮ My side activities: 🎨♟🎧🌐
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the things that I don't know.
- 😄 Pronouns: He would be fine.
- ⚡ Fun fact: The QWERTY keyboard layout was designed to slow you down.

### 🔰 While you are still here have a look at some random quotes
*It changes every day*

<!-- BLOG-POST-LIST:START -->
 1.  "Public opinion is a weak tyrant compared with our own private opinion. What a man thinks of himself, that is which determines, or rather indicates, his fate." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Henry David Thoreau</i> 

 2.  "Pain (any pain--emotional, physical, mental) has a message. The information it has about our life can be remarkably specific, but it usually falls into one of two categories: "We would be more alive if we did more of this," and, "Life would be more lovely if we did less of that." Once we get the pain's message, and follow its advice, the pain goes away." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Peter McWilliams</i> 

 3.  "Man is distinguished from all other creatures by the faculty of laughter." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Joseph Addison</i> 

 4.  "Music is the wine that fills the cup of silence." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Robert Fripp</i>
