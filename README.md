# **_ Hi, you have reached at Mahesh's GitHub profile _**
### 🌸 About me ?
I am INFJ-A, most of the time. Having a discussion about human psychology, count me in, apart from that I am interested in Science, The Universe, and all other super cool stuff including Aliens 🤫. Just like the rest I am also a CS engineer, I try to learn new stuff and on it's way I implement it in my own style. 
- ☮ My side activities: 🎨♟🎧🌐
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the things that I don't know.
- 😄 Pronouns: He would be fine.
- ⚡ Fun fact: The QWERTY keyboard layout was designed to slow you down.

<!-- BLOG-POST-LIST:START -->
 1.  "I didn't go to college at all, any college, and I'm not saying you wasted your time or money, but look at me, I'm a huge celebrity." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Ellen DeGeneres</i> 

 2.  "There was no escaping by means of any journey, however adventurous, one took one's problems and sorrows with one." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Elizabeth Aston</i> 

 3.  "The creative person basically has two kinds of jobs: One is the sexy, creative kind. Second is the kind that pays the bills. Sometimes the task in hand covers both bases, but not often. This tense duality will always play center stage. It will never be transcended." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Hugh Macleod</i> 

 4.  "Tears may be dried up, but the heart - never." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Marguerite de Valois</i>
