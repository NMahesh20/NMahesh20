# **_ Hi, you have reached at Mahesh's GitHub profile _**
### 🌸 About me ?
I am INFJ-A, most of the time. Having a discussion about human psychology, count me in, apart from that I am interested in Science, The Universe, and all other super cool stuff including Aliens 🤫. Just like the rest I am also a CS engineer, I try to learn new stuff and on it's way I implement it in my own style. 
- ☮ My side activities: 🎨♟🎧🌐
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the things that I don't know.
- 😄 Pronouns: He would be fine.
- ⚡ Fun fact: The QWERTY keyboard layout was designed to slow you down.

### 🔰 While you are still here have a look at some random quotes
*It changes every day*

<!-- BLOG-POST-LIST:START -->
 1.  "I deal with stress in two ways because there are two kinds of stress. There's stress that you can take care of and there's stress that you can't. The first one, I take care of it as fast as possible, because putting it off always makes it worse. Things that I can't fix? I think about the fact that I can't fix them. I think about why I can't fix them and I come to terms with the fact that this is a problem that I'm not going to overcome and that the world is not a wish granting factory." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Hank Green</i> 

 2.  "Dreams come true. Without that possibility, nature would not incite us to have them." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by John Updike</i> 

 3.  "Don't limit a child to your own learning, for he was born in another time." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Rabbinical Saying</i> 

 4.  "Death comes to all/ But great achievements raise a monument/ Which shall endure until the sun grows old." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by George Fabricius</i>
