# **_ Hi, you have reached at Mahesh's GitHub profile _**
### 🌸 About me ?
I am INFJ-A, most of the time. Having a discussion about human psychology, count me in, apart from that I am interested in Science, The Universe, and all other super cool stuff including Aliens 🤫. Just like the rest I am also a CS engineer, I try to learn new stuff and on it's way I implement it in my own style. 
- ☮ My side activities: 🎨♟🎧🌐
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the things that I don't know.
- 😄 Pronouns: He would be fine.
- ⚡ Fun fact: The QWERTY keyboard layout was designed to slow you down.

 1.  "It is all very well, when the pen flows, but then there are the dark days when imagination deserts one, and it is an effort to put anything down on paper.

 2.  "A person's abilities are tested best when defending rather than attacking." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Takayuki Ikkaku, Arisa Hosaka and Toshihiro Kawabata</i> 

 3.  "The bow cannot always stand bent, nor can human frailty subsist without some lawful recreation." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Miguel de Cervantes</i> 

 4.  "Everything has got a moral if you can only find it." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Lewis Carroll</i>
