# **_ Hi, you have reached at Mahesh's GitHub profile _**
### 🌸 About me ?
I am INFJ-A, most of the time. Having a discussion about human psychology, count me in, apart from that I am interested in Science, The Universe, and all other super cool stuff including Aliens 🤫. Just like the rest I am also a CS engineer, I try to learn new stuff and on it's way I implement it in my own style. 
- ☮ My side activities: 🎨♟🎧🌐
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the things that I don't know.
- 😄 Pronouns: He would be fine.
- ⚡ Fun fact: The QWERTY keyboard layout was designed to slow you down.

*It changes every day*

<!-- BLOG-POST-LIST:START -->
 1.  "No one wants to die. Even people who want to go to heaven don't want to die to get there. And yet, death is the destination we all share. No one has ever escaped it, and that is how it should be, because death is very likely the single best invention of life. It's life's change agent. It clears out the old to make way for the new." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Steve Jobs</i> 

 2.  "One kind word can warm three winter months." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Japanese proverb</i> 

 3.  "It is when power is wedded to chronic fear that it becomes formidable." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Eric Hoffer</i> 

 4.  "The art of living easily as to money is to pitch your scale of living one degree below your means." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Sir Henry Taylor</i>
