# **_ Hi, you have reached at Mahesh's GitHub profile _**
### 🌸 About me ?
I am INFJ-A, most of the time. Having a discussion about human psychology, count me in, apart from that I am interested in Science, The Universe, and all other super cool stuff including Aliens 🤫. Just like the rest I am also a CS engineer, I try to learn new stuff and on it's way I implement it in my own style. 
- ☮ My side activities: 🎨♟🎧🌐
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the things that I don't know.
- 😄 Pronouns: He would be fine.
- ⚡ Fun fact: The QWERTY keyboard layout was designed to slow you down.

<!-- BLOG-POST-LIST:START -->

 2.  "Do what you love, love what you do, leave the world a better place and don't pick your nose." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Jeff Mallett</i>

 4.  "A ship in port is safe, but that's not what ships are built for." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Grace Murray Hopper</i>
