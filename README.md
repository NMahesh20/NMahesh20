# **_ Hi, you have reached at Mahesh's GitHub profile _**
### 🌸 About me ?
I am INFJ-A, most of the time. Having a discussion about human psychology, count me in, apart from that I am interested in Science, The Universe, and all other super cool stuff including Aliens 🤫. Just like the rest I am also a CS engineer, I try to learn new stuff and on it's way I implement it in my own style. 
- ☮ My side activities: 🎨♟🎧🌐
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the things that I don't know.
- 😄 Pronouns: He would be fine.
- ⚡ Fun fact: The QWERTY keyboard layout was designed to slow you down.

*It changes every day*

<!-- BLOG-POST-LIST:START -->

Winners can tell you where they are going, what they plan to do along the way, and who will be sharing the adventure with them." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Denis Watley</i> 

 2.  "Never make a defense or an apology until you are accused." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by King Charles I</i> 

 3.  "You may be deceived if you trust too much, but you will live in torment if you do not trust enough." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Frank Crane</i> 

 4.  "To find fulfillment...don't exist with life - embrace it." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Jim Beggs</i>
