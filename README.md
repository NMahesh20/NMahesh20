# **_ Hi, you have reached at Mahesh's GitHub profile _**
### 🌸 About me ?
I am INFJ-A, most of the time. Having a discussion about human psychology, count me in, apart from that I am interested in Science, The Universe, and all other super cool stuff including Aliens 🤫. Just like the rest I am also a CS engineer, I try to learn new stuff and on it's way I implement it in my own style. 
- ☮ My side activities: 🎨♟🎧🌐
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the things that I don't know.
- 😄 Pronouns: He would be fine.
- ⚡ Fun fact: The QWERTY keyboard layout was designed to slow you down.

### 🔰 While you are still here have a look at some random quotes
*It changes every day*

<!-- BLOG-POST-LIST:START -->
 1.  "You never know how a horse will pull until you hook him up to a heavy load." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Paul "Bear" Bryant</i> 

 2.  "You are today where your thoughts have brought you; you will be tomorrow where your thoughts take you." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by James Lane Allen</i> 

 3.  "He who endeavors to serve, to benefit, and improve the world, is like a swimmer, who struggles against a rapid current, in a river lashed into angry waves by the winds. Often they roar over his head, often they beat him back and baffle him. Most men yield to the stress of the current... Only here and there the stout, strong heart and vigorous arms struggle on toward ultimate success." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Albert Pike</i> 

 4.  "Leave each one his touch of folly; it helps to lighten life's burden which, if he could see himself as he is, might be too heavy to carry." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by John Lancaster Spalding</i>
