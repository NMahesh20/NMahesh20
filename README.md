# **_ Hi, you have reached at Mahesh's GitHub profile _**
### 🌸 About me ?
I am INFJ-A, most of the time. Having a discussion about human psychology, count me in, apart from that I am interested in Science, The Universe, and all other super cool stuff including Aliens 🤫. Just like the rest I am also a CS engineer, I try to learn new stuff and on it's way I implement it in my own style. 
- ☮ My side activities: 🎨♟🎧🌐
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the things that I don't know.
- 😄 Pronouns: He would be fine.
- ⚡ Fun fact: The QWERTY keyboard layout was designed to slow you down.

### 🔰 While you are still here have a look at some random quotes
*It changes every day*

<!-- BLOG-POST-LIST:START -->
 1.  "There is an expiry date on blaming your parents for steering you in the wrong direction. The moment you are old enough to take the wheel, the responsibility lies with you." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by J. K. Rowling</i> 

 2.  "Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life. Don't be trapped by dogma - which is living with the results of other people's thinking. Don't let the noise of other's opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Steve Jobs</i> 

 3.  "The only comfort comes in thinking about how nice it was to know them, and how nice it was to brush against goodness for a season." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Gordon Atkinson</i> 

 4.  "Everything I did in my life that was worthwhile I caught hell for." <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>-by Earl Warren</i>
